## TACTICS
The Concupiscentia Tree is a carnivorous plant that hunts by producing fruit which is so indescribably tantalizing to those who view it that they are overcome with an irresistible desire to consume the fruit and rest in the shade of the beautiful tree. Though it is capable of overland movement, it is so slow that it only moves if it believes it must to entice more food.
