## TACTICS
If one is able to overcome the Concupiscentia’s irresistible temptation, defeating it is actually surprisingly easy. Conventional slashing weapons can hurt it, and it’s extreme weakness to fire also prevents it from spewing it’s narcotic sap, which is it’s only real defense mechanism beyond the fruit. If it finds itself in extreme danger, a Concupiscentia can use it’s limbs offensively, but is not inclined to except as a last resort, as injuries to it’s boughs can cause irreversible damage to it’s fruits, causing it difficulty in hunting for months while it heals.

## SPECIAL ABILITIES
### Sinful Fruit (Su)
The Concupiscentia Tree produces fruits which have an almost hypnotic effect upon those that see them, filling them with an indescribable urge to consume the fruit of the tree. A creature charmed by the Concupiscentia Tree’s fruits can take no actions other than move actions to approach and eat from the tree. A DC 37 Will Save negates this effect. A creature who eats the fruits of a Concupiscentia Tree becomes psychically linked to the tree, and enthralled by it as [dominate person](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dominate-person/). A Concupiscentia Tree can spend it’s move action to concentrate on a living linked creature and [command](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/command/) it. The Concupiscentia Tree gains the following option to [command](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/command/) a linked creature with:

>**Sleep:** The target becomes drowsy, falling completely unconscious in 1d2 rounds after the Concupiscentia uses this command.
### Longing Beyond Death
A Concupiscentia Tree is often surrounded by the desiccated and skeletal remains of it’s victims, but their longing for the fruit of the tree is unabated, even in death. At the beginning of combat, roll 6d6 to determine the number of corpses surrounding the Concupiscentia. As a Standard Action, the Concupiscentia Tree can raise 1d6+1 of it’s corpses as either [Skeletons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/skeleton-medium/) or [Zombies](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/zombie/).

### Narcotic Sap
When a Concupiscentia tree is hit with a weapon that deals piercing or bludgeoning damage, it spews highly concentrated narcotic sap at the attacker. The attacking creature must make a DC 37 Reflex saving throw or be sprayed with the sap. A creature whose exposed skin makes contact with the narcotic sap must make a DC  Will save or become [stunned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/GAMEMASTERING/CONDITIONS/#stunned) for 1d4 hours. At the end of that time, the creature must roll 1d6 and determine their status on the following table
