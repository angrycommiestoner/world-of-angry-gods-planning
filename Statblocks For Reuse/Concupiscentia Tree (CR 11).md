## TACTICS
The Concupiscentia Tree is a carnivorous plant that hunts by producing fruit which is so indescribably tantalizing to those who view it that they are overcome with an irresistible desire to consume the fruit and rest in the shade of the beautiful tree. Though it is capable of overland movement, it is so slow that it only moves if it believes it must to entice more food.

## SPECIAL ABILITIES
### Sinful Fruit (Su)
The Concupiscentia Tree produces fruits which have an almost hypnotic effect upon those that see them, filling them with an indescribable urge to consume the fruit of the tree. A creature charmed by the Concupiscentia Tree’s fruits can take no actions other than move actions to approach and eat from the tree. A DC 42 Will Save negates this effect.

A creature who eats the fruits of a Concupiscentia Tree becomes psychically linked to the tree, and enthralled by it.
