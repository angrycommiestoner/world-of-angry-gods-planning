## Abyss Hound (CR 3)
_Some legends tell of a deal between Szuriel and Asmodeus that resulted in these mongrelized, Daemonic cousins to the infernal Hellhound, though som perhaps merely a rare case of covergent evolution across the astral sea, these horrifying persistence hunters can be found across the multiverse wherever there are battlefields. The fully grown variant are a favorite pet and mount of high-ranking Daemon-worshipping Anti-Paladins and Clerics._

### Description

An Abyssal Hound resembles a demented artist's vision of a greyhound, standing at between 4–5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing 120 pounds on average. It is said that Abyss Hounds hunger endlessly and, once they have sunk their teeth into prey, they will hold on relentlessly until they drag their prey down from sheer exhaustion.
