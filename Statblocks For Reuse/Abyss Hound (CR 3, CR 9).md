# Abyss Hound (CR 3)
_Some legends tell of a deal between Szuriel and Asmodeus that resulted in these mongrelized, Daemonic cousins to the infernal Hellhound. Some scholars, however, suggest perhaps, that their appearance is merely a rare case of covergent evolution across the astral sea. Whatever the case, these horrifying persistence hunters can be found across the multiverse wherever there are battlefields. They often possess warhounds and weave minor enchantments about their "owners" to disregard the odd changes such beasts undergo_

### Description

An Abyssal Hound resembles a demented artist's vision of a greyhound, standing at between 4–5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing 120 pounds on average. It is said that Abyss Hounds hunger endlessly and, once they have sunk their teeth into prey, they will hold on relentlessly until they drag their prey down from sheer exhaustion.

These mad, snarling hounds' whole bodies are covered in glaring, blood red eyes. Each stands easily as tall as a man. While far less mindlessly loyal than their infernal counterparts, their snapping fangs, razor-sharp claws and immense size still make them favored mounts and pets for Daemon-worshipping Clerics and Antipaladins. Abyss Hounds that have reached this life stage have typically staked out large hunting grounds for themselves within the Abyss, rather than possessing and corrupting warhounds in the Prime Material, and are often far too aggressive to come together with others of their species aside from to occasionally perform whatever unholy acts pass for reproduction among Daemonkind. Even then, Abyss Hound pups are powerful enough hunters to fend for themselves within hours of being born. Some especially old Stygian Abyss Hounds may even begin displaying signs of advanced intelligence, collecting trophies from their hunts and reveling in the remembered horror of the tortured, roiling soul screaming for all eternity within their very essence.
