# What Is A Downtime Quest?
A downtime quest is a simple, non-combat quest that adventurers can undertake using their downtime. Downtime quests can be limited-time events related to the completion of specific goals on the server or downtime quests can be simple time-fillers that can be undertaken year-round to gain additional Fame, GP, and XP rewards.

# Designing A Downtime Quest
First, decide what you’d like your downtime quest to be about. If you’re designing a generic downtime quest, try to keep the parameters simple and applicable to life anywhere on Golarion. Examples of good “generic” downtime quest ideas include “Volunteer with the town guard”, “Help local farming communities”, or “Build local infrastructure”. For downtime quests specific to a server-wide event, try to think of ways the event might affect daily life on Golarion, even without direct confrontation with world-ending threats and give players ways to help the people of the world. Examples of event-specific downtime quests might be “Relocate orphaned children” or “aid wounded civilians” or “stockpile weapons and armor for the next attack”. Not all PCs will be eligible for all event-specific downtime quests, but generic downtime quests should never be designed in a way that requires players to be in the right place at the right time.

Once you have a concept for your downtime quest, you will need to determine the following qualities of your downtime quest:
- Associated Skills
- Rate of Failure
- Consequences of Failure
- Easy, Medium, and Hard Associated Skill Check DCs
- Quest Repeatability/Associated Skill Check DC Increase per Repeat
- Rewards for Success

Some of those qualities might be obvious, but others might be less so, so let’s break down each piece of that puzzle.

**Associated Skills:** This is the list of skills that a PC can use to accomplish the goals of the downtime quest. Most downtime quests will use at least one Craft skill (see [[Character Creation Rules#Craft Skills|Craft Skills]]) or an equivalent Profession skill, a combination of Knowledge skills, and any other skills as determined by the DM.

**Rate of Failure:** This is the percentage chance of a downtime quest going terribly, horribly wrong no matter the result of the skill check. Most Downtime quests have a rate of failure of 0-10%, however some exceptionally dangerous quests may have a higher rate of failure.

**Consequences of Failure:** Any consequence
