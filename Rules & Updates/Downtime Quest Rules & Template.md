# What Is A Downtime Quest?
A downtime quest is a simple, non-combat quest that adventurers can undertake using their downtime. Downtime quests can be limited-time events related to the completion of specific goals on the server or downtime quests can be simple time-fillers that can be undertaken year-round to gain additional Fame, GP, and XP rewards.

# Designing A Downtime Quest
First, decide what you’d like your downtime quest to be about. If you’re designing a generic downtime quest, try to keep the parameters simple and applicable to life anywhere on Golarion. Examples of good “generic” downtime quest ideas include “Volunteer with the town guard”, “Help local farming communities”, or “Build local infrastructure”. For downtime quests specific to a server-wide event, try to think of ways the event might affect daily life on Golarion, even without direct confrontation with world-ending threats and give players ways to help the people of the world. Examples of event-specific downtime quests might be “Relocate orphaned children” or “aid wounded civilians” or “stockpile weapons and armor for the next attack”. Not all PCs will be eligible for all event-specific downtime quests, but generic downtime quests should never be designed in a way that requires players to be in the right place at the right time.

Once you have a concept for your downtime quest, you will need to determine the following qualities of your downtime quest:

- Quest Availability
- Length of Quest
- Associated Skills
- Rate of Failure
- Consequences of Failure
- Easy, Medium, and Hard Associated Skill Check DCs
- Quest Repeatability/Associated Skill Check DC Increase per Repeat
- Rewards for Success

Some of those qualities might be obvious, but others might be less so, so let’s break down each piece of that puzzle.

**Quest Availability:** The dates through which the downtime quest will be available. If the DM is designing a generic quest with no explicit end date, they may ignore this quality

**Length of Quest:** The length, expressed in days or weeks of downtime, required to complete a single instance of a downtime quest. Most downtime quests will take between 1-3 days of downtime to complete.

**Associated Skills:** This is the list of skills that a PC can use to accomplish the goals of the downtime quest. Most downtime quests will use at least one Craft skill (see [[Character Creation Rules#Craft Skills|Craft Skills]]) or an equivalent Profession skill, a combination of Knowledge skills, and any other skills as determined by the DM.

**Rate of Failure:** This is the percentage chance of a downtime quest going terribly, horribly wrong no matter the result of the skill check. Most Downtime quests have a rate of failure of 0-10%, however some exceptionally dangerous quests may have a higher rate of failure.

**Consequences of Failure:** Any consequences for failing a downtime quest will be listed here. A player may fail a downtime quest either by rolling the percentage rate of failure chance on a d100 when they complete the quest or by failing on their associated skill check by 10 or more than the DC for the difficulty they chose.

**Easy, Medium, and Hard Associated Skill Check DCs:** Each downtime quest has 3 difficulties by default, “Easy”, “Medium”, and “Hard”. Easy DCs should be able to be beaten by a level 2-3 character taking 10 on the associated skill check. Medium DCs should be able to be beaten by a level 8-10 character taking 10 on the associated skill check. Hard DCs should be able to be beaten by a level 14-15 character taking 10 on the skill check.

**Quest Repeatability/Associated Skill Check DC Increase per Repeat:** Not all downtime quests will be designed to be repeated. For those that are, however, each repetition will increase the associated skill check DC by a certain amount. This can be expressed as a series of incremental values (i.e. +2/+4/+6) to express different increases across difficulty levels, but it should be assumed that a single value means the increase is the same at each difficulty level. The DC increase for downtime quests with no explicit expiration date resets with downtime at the beginning of every week.

**Rewards For Success**
Downtime Quests should *always* have slightly better rewards than what a character who isn’t min/maxed on crafting can accomplish with downtime; If a downtime quest rewards Fame, XP, and GP, for example, a player who might otherwise use their downtime to earn just one of those rewards could be encouraged to interact with broader narratives and feel as if they are making an impact on the server, while gaining greater immediate rewards. Do not hesitate to get creative with rewards for downtime quests, or to offer increased rewards for higher difficulty DCs.

# Sample Downtime Quest: Bolster Local Guard
“Do YOU wanna make a difference in your community?” The faded poster reads “Then volunteer for the town guard TODAY!”
**Length of Quest:** 1 Day
**Associated Skills:** Craft (Alchemy, Firearms, Leatherworking, Metalworking), Handle Animal, Heal, Intimidate, Knowledge (Engineering), Profession (Soldier, Mercenary, etc.), Ride
**Rate of Failure:** 0%
**Consequences of Failure:** Your performance is particularly unsatisfactory.  progress towards this downtime quest and 1 day of downtime for the week. You may not repeat this quest until you pay a fee for your behavior equal to 20 GP x character level squared
**Associated Skill Check DCs:** DC 14 Easy; DC 27 Medium; DC 32 Hard
