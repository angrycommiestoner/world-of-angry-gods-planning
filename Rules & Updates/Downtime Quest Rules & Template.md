# What Is A Downtime Quest?
A downtime quest is a simple, non-combat quest that adventurers can undertake using their downtime. Downtime quests can be limited-time events related to the completion of specific goals on the server or downtime quests can be simple time-fillers that can be undertaken year-round to gain additional Fame, GP, and XP rewards.

Examples of good “generic” downtime quest ideas include “Volunteer with the town guard”, “Help local farming communities”, or “Build local infrastructure”.
