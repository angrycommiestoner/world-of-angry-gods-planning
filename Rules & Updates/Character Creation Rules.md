  All characters must be submitted for final approval by the Game Masters in a ticket within the discord server. Characters should be submitted on complete character sheets which contain all of the selections chosen, and any relevant information about those selections. Players may use a character sheet format of their choice, provided that it contains all relevant information, including at which level each choice was made.

  

All character submissions should include a list of which variant rules the character is using, if any, and which of the approved third party resources the character is using, if any.

  

On rare occasion, characters may be given conditional approval. When this happens, the GM approving will explain that this is the case, and what conditions may cause for the character to need to be reworked. If the character is then eventually called back for a rework, the player will be given the opportunity to partially rebuild the character in order to correct whatever caused issue while still preserving as much of the character as possible. Although when possible, GMs will point these issues out early, to allow for the removal of these complications prior to character approval.

  

It should be noted that many changes made within these house rules have a potential to drastically increase character power if stacked in very particular ways, but the GMs are aware of many of the more egregious examples of these and would politely request that players not engage in them. The intent of these changes is to enable character options that were not previously as functional as players would have desired, and to allow for slightly more versatile styles of play. Powergaming to an extent that it causes other players to have difficulty enjoying themselves will result in a player being asked to make adjustments to their characters build. So have fun, go nuts, but don’t be a dick about it.

  

Players may create three characters each. Specific server events and rewards may allow a player to earn opportunities to have additional characters

# Character Creation Rules

## Attributes and Build Options

  

All characters start at level one.

  

Attributes are purchased with your choice of a 20 point buy, or the following 6 stats in any order you choose: 16, 16, 14, 13, 12, 10. All listed attributes are before racial bonuses.

  

Characters gain maximum hit points at first level. Instead of rolling, at every level other than first they gain HP as though they had rolled an amount equal to 2 less than the maximum amount allowed on the dice (4 for d6, 8 for d10, etc.), this does not include Constitution bonuses, or bonus HP from other sources. This does not change what their hit die is for the purposes of retraining or otherwise increasing their hit point values in relation to their hit die. Animal Companions, Cohorts, Followers, and other player related creatures gain hit points using the same rules that player characters do, using their own respective hit die.

  

All characters start with up to 200g worth of equipment and 25g in cash. Any gold not spent from the 200g allotted for equipment is lost upon character approval.

  

All players start with two traits of their choosing. Players can take multiple traits from the same trait category, but they may only take regional traits from one region. A character must be worshipers of a deity in order to take religion traits associated with that deity. If they stop worshiping that deity, they lose the benefits of those traits, but do not gain new traits to replace ones lost.

  

Characters may be made from any alignment. However, playing an evil alignment does not allow one to further violate server rules, and cruel or harassing behavior to other players, descriptions of excessive gore, sexual violence, or other over the top behavior will receive strikes and eventually cause a character to be removed and a player to be banned if repeated. GMs and moderators have the final discretion as to what counts as excessive, cruel, or harassing behavior.

  

Players may choose to select up to two drawbacks. They gain an additional trait for each drawback they select. Alternatively, a player may select an additional feat in exchange for two traits gained through this method.

  

Characters may opt to choose one [Major Drawback](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/3rd-party-drawbacks/rogue-genius-games/major-drawbacks/) in exchange for a bonus feat.

  

All characters gain an additional 2 skill points per level. This is in addition to the skill points granted by the Background Skills variant rules. So a Fighter would now possess 4+Int modifier skill points per level, with 2 additional ranks which must be spent on background skills, while a rogue would possess 10+Int modifier skill points per level, with 2 additional ranks which must be spent on background skills. Add these additional skill points to the classes' count of skill ranks per level when determining effects such as Spheres of Guile Trade Traditions.

  

Characters may be created using any race from the allowed sources with an RP value below 16. A list of allowed races, with links to their content, [has been collated for player use here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSCR_YEyP6fPV7XmWQJnX9fi4bwHmFngVIYXikmsQ4Nq5Uo4Yym7dFmoxFS3IHB4oP6agzNmU8IIBIl/pubhtml?gid=753126413&single=true).

If a race includes a variant racial feat with a d% roll for an option, they may choose an option at their preference, but may not choose an option that grants the selection of multiple additional options. If they would prefer to roll, a GM must witness the roll.

Players may choose to build a custom race as well, using the [Race Builder rules](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/creating-new-races/). All custom races are subject to approval. Custom races that fill niches already filled by existing available races, or that utilize more than 16 RP are extremely unlikely to be approved. Custom Race Builder options [have been added here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRwa4BWcxXPwCAAwZIfN-_3I4TB-g6DX6Vs_hgcU_2TXk-sHtTp7OJnTZb20ho7P8e6GacUvMuhEtkC/pub) along with their respective points. These options may be expanded on in the future. Characters may not select the Advanced attribute option when building a custom race.

For characters with Animal Companions, a list of animal companion options from allowed sources have been collated into a [spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSccaISuCmCoZfCecFIL1B-o1seFne1OnSCbvStPBVDxmLwf7G4amJto_nbR0vNS39MCQwxK_emOYQR/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true) for player convenience

  

A player may choose to sacrifice all of the racial traits and attribute bonuses associated with their race choice in order to instead create a custom Origin Tradition using the [Spheres of Power custom Origin Tradition rules](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/origins). All custom origin traditions are subject to approval.

  

Characters additionally gain one Potent Talent from the Origin Tradition rules at 1st level, 5th level, and every 5 levels thereafter.

  

In every case where a character may choose a potent origin talent, they may elect instead to choose two auxiliary or utility talents.

  

Any character may opt to trade their weapon and armor proficiencies for a Martial Tradition from Spheres of Might as long as their normal starting proficiencies include proficiency with all martial weapons or at least one exotic weapon , using the rules listed for that, regardless of other sources used. This works as follows. However, this does not automatically allow any character to use any more Spheres of Might talents than are granted by default from the Martial Tradition. 

- Characters who trade in proficiencies to gain a martial tradition (rather than gaining one from a class) must trade in proficiencies from all of their classes, but characters who gain a martial tradition from a class do not lose any proficiencies that they gain normally.
    
- A character who possesses a martial tradition, via trading in proficiencies or via gaining it from a class gains another equipment (discipline) talent or Armor Training talent for every additional class they take beyond the first. If they are a Gestalt character, they gain this additional talent for their second class taken at level one. 
    

- If the class would possess martial weapon proficiency or grant a martial tradition, the character may gain two such talents. Characters who choose this option maintain any proficiencies they may have had in simple weapons, light armor, and/or bucklers. 
    

  

Any character may opt to trade their class skills for a [Trade Tradition](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/trade-traditions) from Spheres of Guile, using the rules listed for that, regardless of other sources used. However, this does not allow any character to use any more Spheres of Guile talents than are granted by default from the Trade Tradition. A character who selects this option gains another Vocation (trade) talent for every additional class they take beyond the first. Characters using this option may find [the spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n7ScgP1cQ-rEfYCafCX_QCMKkCZ8XGa5OMcxeHAty9Y/edit?usp=sharing) useful for helping pick trade talents.

  

Characters submitted with an in depth and interesting backstory and character concept may be given bonus experience and additional starting gold upon character creation, at the discretion of the approving GM. We are not looking for specific word counts, and players should write however much they feel carries the story that they intend to tell, but rather details about the character's life, plot hook opportunities, attachments to their surroundings or the world, and a compelling narrative for the character.

  

All characters are now granted a single [Flask of the Dawn](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/marvelous-items#toc33) upon character creation. This cannot be sold and is effectively worth zero gold. This flask is capable of healing that specific character. If they are healed by positive energy, than the flask heals with positive energy, however, if they are healed with negative energy, it heals with negative energy. It cannot be used to deal damage. This flask never counts towards the player’s wealth. Flask shards to upgrade this specific Flask of the Dawn cannot be purchased, but may be obtained through various means in play.

## Allowed Sources

  

The section below details which sources are allowed to be used for character creation and in what contexts. If you have doubts about whether a source is permitted, feel free to ask a GM.

The subsystems below have been approved for use, including most content created by the original publishers of those subsystems. 

  

Characters may only utilize the subsystems of up to TWO of the listed bullet points per character without prior approval from a GM. It is important to note that for Gestalt characters, the number of allowed bullet points may change based on multiclassing variants chosen at level One.

  

When submitting a character application, a character must list which of the 3pp subsystems they are using, and how they expect them to interact with each other.

## Experience

Characters leveling in this server use the Medium experience track, unless specified elsewhere. Characters who opt for a Gestalt character build use a Slow experience track to level.

## Wealth By Level

Characters are not restricted in how much wealth they are able to obtain, but there is a minimum amount that characters will receive. When leveling up to each new level, characters immediately receive the amount listed in the character advancement chart for the level that they have just reached, and the track for the variant rules they have selected.

  

3-Adventure Trial

After your first three adventures, or while leveling up at any point before level 4, you may submit a character to the GMs for changes with no expected retraining costs or time. This is to address unhappiness for you as a player, if a build isn’t playing how you thought it would, it does not exist to help get past “pain spots” within a build. If it’s something the character would want to do, or it is necessary for the mechanics of a build as originally planned, the character is still expected to spend time and costs retraining. Any given character can only take advantage of this free retraining once.

## Character Gear Value Limits

  

No character may have gear equipped whose total value exceeds 3 x the wealth by level value for their character level. Characters utilizing Automatic Bonus Progression may not have gear equipped whose total value exceeds 1.5 x the wealth by level for their character level. This does not limit the actual gold a character can earn, as characters engaged over very long periods, or who invest in making gold rather than experience may exceed these limits. Rather this limits the net value of the items they may have equipped on their character, so that they remain within a power level obtainable by other characters of that level.

  

Cohorts, animal companions and familiars may have their own equipment which do not count against this limit. The player who they answer to must still provide all of their equipment out of their own wealth, but the equipment they use does not count against limits set out for the character they answer to. Instead, cohorts, animal companions, familiars, and other such subordinate creatures may not have gear equipped whose value exceeds the wealth by level for their Hit Dice. If the character they answer to is using Automatic Bonus Progression, they may not exceed 1/2 the wealth by level for their HD.

  

For this purpose, gear includes enchanted armor, shields, weapons, and all magical items which are considered non-consumable in nature, such as wondrous items (including slotless or carried wondrous items), rings, rods, staves, magical tattoos, demonic implants, genie seals, shadow piercings, and other items of that nature.

  

Wands (including eternal wands), scrolls, potions, alchemical items (tools, weapons, and remedies), unenchanted armor and weapons, mundane adventuring gear, clothing, spellbooks/formula books, poisons, trade goods, or other single use items with a cost below 1,000 gp per 2 character levels do not count against this limit.

  

This also does not include anything that would not be actively equipped to the character, such as investments, capital value, or the value of actual coinage.

# Variant and Optional Rules in Play 

## Gestalt

This server allows characters to use the Gestalt character option. This allows characters to take two classes at every level, choosing the best aspects of each. This process is very similar to multiclassing, except that the characters gain the full benefit of each class at each level. If the two classes you choose possess aspects that overlap (such as Hit Dice, attack progression, saves, and class features common to more than one class), you choose the better aspect. This gestalt character retains all aspects that don’t overlap.

  

When building a gestalt character, that character follows the Slow experience track. 

  

While building a gestalt character, choose two standard classes, along with any archetypes or options relevant to those classes. The following guidelines then apply.

  

Hit Dice

Choose the larger Hit Die. A monk/sorcerer would use d8 as her Hit Die and have 8 hit points (plus Constitution modifier) at 1st level, for example.

  

Base Attack Bonus

Choose the better progression from the two classes. If a given character has multiclassed, add up the BAB progression for the complete path to their current level and compare that to the BAB progression for the other complete path to their current level, use the higher number between the two.

  

Base Saving Throw Bonuses

For each save bonus, choose the better progression from the two classes. For example, a 1st-level gestalt fighter/wizard would have base saving throw bonuses of Fortitude +2, Reflex +0, Will +2 — taking the good Fortitude save from the fighter class and the good Will save from the wizard class. If a given character has multiclassed, add up the Base Saving Throw progression for the complete path to their current level and compare that to the Base Saving Throw progression for the other complete path to their current level, use the higher number between the two.

  

Class Skills

Take the number of skill points gained per level from whichever class grants more skill points, and consider any skill on either class list as a class skill for the gestalt character. For example, a gestalt barbarian/bard would gain skill points per level equal to 6 + Int modifier, and treats class skills from both the barbarian and bard lists as class skills.

Class Features

A gestalt character gains the class features of both classes. A 1st-level gestalt rogue/cleric, for example, gets sneak attack +1d6, trapfinding, 1st-level cleric spells, domains, and channel energy. Class- and ability-based restrictions (such as arcane spell failure chance and a druid’s prohibition on wearing metal armor) apply normally to a gestalt character, no matter what the other class is.

A gestalt character follows a similar procedure when he attains 2nd and subsequent levels. Each time he gains a new level, he chooses two classes, takes the best aspects of each, and applies them to his characteristics. A few caveats apply, however.

1. Gestalt characters with more than one spellcasting class keep track of their spells per day separately.
    
2. When taking a prestige class with prerequisites on either progression of their gestalt path, a character must qualify for it using class features on that side of their gestalt path. Skill Points, Feats, Base Attack Bonus, Base Saves, and abilities gained from race selection contribute to prerequisites on both gestalt paths, but class features and other class based abilities contribute only to the path on which the class was taken. For example, a character who intends to take Arcane Archer could use the Base Attack Bonus and feats gained on either side of their character progression. However, they must have gained their ability to cast arcane spells on the path that they intend to take Arcane Archer.
    
3. A gestalt character may combine two prestige classes, or a prestige class and a regular class at each level.
    
4. When gestalting a character using Spheres of Might, even when only present on one progression, you gain additional Equipment (discipline) talents at level one, as though you had also taken a level in a new class. This is in addition to the additional Equipment (discipline) talents gained for every new class that you take a level in beyond those you had at first level.
    
5. When gestalting a character using a Spheres of Guile Trade Tradition, you gain an additional Vocation (trade) talent at level one. This is in addition to the additional Vocation (trade) talent gained for every new class that you take a level in beyond those you had at first level.
    
6. A gestalt character with initiator levels calculates the initiator levels for both of their progressions separately. Use the higher of those two progressions for all initiating abilities and maneuvers, unless specifically stated otherwise by an ability such as Martial Training.
    
7. A character who progresses Pact Magic binder levels on both progressions calculates their binder levels and maximum spirit levels for each class separately. The number of spirits they may bind is calculated separately for each progression, so at level one a Pactmaker/Barbarian (totemic sage) would be able to bind two spirits to their soul.
    
8. A character who progresses akashic veilweaving on both progressions tracks their veilweaving level for each progression separately and uses the higher of those two for all veils. They do not gain any additional chakra slots in which to bind veils. They gain a separate essence pool for each progression, including all essence granted by class abilities for that progression as well as from character levels. Essence from either pool can be invested in any veil, but a character cannot invest essence from both pools into a single veil.
    

Characters gestalting Spheres of Might or Spheres of Power characters on both sides of their gestalt, use the following rules for handling that scenario:

1. If you have classes with conflicting casting or practitioner ability modifiers, choose one casting ability modifier and one practitioner ability modifier to use for those two classes. (For example, if one class requires you to use Charisma and the other requires you to use Wisdom, you can choose to use either Charisma or Wisdom for both of those classes.) This only applies to the classes you gain at first level. Any classes gained later use their normal casting/practitioner ability modifiers. 
    
2. Characters progressing Spheres of Power casting on both sides of their gestalt must choose one of the following:
    

3. Sphere Variant A: Characters using this choice may not gain caster level based on level faster than they would as a high caster. 
    

4. Gestalt characters with more than one Spheres class combine their talents and use the higher of their caster and levels. Note that classes that provide access to certain spheres at a higher level (such as the shifter using their class level, rather than caster level, for the Alteration sphere) still cannot get a ‘basic’ power level with that sphere higher than what a High-Caster could. In other words, a 5th-level incanter/shifter would only have CL 5th with the Alteration sphere.
    
5. Characters using this option should calculate their spell point pools separately and then add them together to determine their total spell pool.
    
6. Characters using this advancement combine their magic talent advancements from their respective classes. This functions as follows. Characters who take two classes granting 1/2 of a talent each level, now gain 1 talent each level. Characters who take a class granting 3/4 of a talent each level, as well as a class which grants 1/2 of a talent each level now gain 1 talent each level, as well as one additional talent at level 4 and every four levels thereafter. Characters who take two classes which gain 3/4 of a talent each level or greater, now gain 1 talent each level, as well as one additional talent at level 1 and every two levels thereafter. This is demonstrated on the chart below for simplicity. 
    

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Level|1/2 Talent + 1/2 Talent|1/2 Talent + 3/4 Talent|3/4 Talent + 3/4 Talent  <br>3/4 Talent + 1 Talents  <br>1/2 Talent + 1 Talents  <br>1 Talents + 1 Talents|
|1|1 (2)|1 (2)|2 (2)|
|2|1|1|1|
|3|1|1|2|
|4|1|2|1|
|5|1|1|2|
|6|1|1|1|
|7|1|1|2|
|8|1|2|1|
|9|1|1|2|

|11|1|1|2|
|12|1|2|1|
|13|1|1|2|
|14|1|1|1|
|15|1|1|2|
|16|1|2|1|
|17|1|1|2|
|18|1|1|1|
|19|1|1|2|
|20|1|2|1|

2. Sphere Variant B: characters using this choice must take a separate casting tradition for each gestalt path, treating them as separate casting progressions. These traditions may be very similar, but are tracked separately for all purposes. Characters using this variant have a separate caster level and gain talents separately for each gestalt path. The talents gained within one path may not interact with the talents gained within the other, although the same talent may be taken within both gestalt paths, if so desired. For example, a 5th level incanter/armorist would have two casting traditions, counting as a high caster and a low caster, respectively.
    

3. A gestalt character using this variant may trade feats for combat talent progression (under the normal rules in Spheres of Might for doing so) even if they have a High-Caster class on one side of the gestalt, but only if they have at least one class that is not a High-Caster at any given level. If the character has two High-Caster classes at a given level, that level does not count for the purpose of combat talent progression from trading feats. Remember that this combat talent progression does not stack with class levels that grant combat talents normally — you cannot get extra combat talents for classes that already provide combat talents through this trade. A gestalt character using Sphere Variant A may trade feats for combat talent progression without concern for this restriction.
    

4. Multiple increases to a sphere’s effective caster level from getting it as a class ability do not stack. This is most likely to come up when using archetypes. These abilities rarely intend to offer more than “full” progression, and gestalt characters should respect that intention. For example, a gestalt elementalist/incanter would not have their Destruction sphere abilities progress at any rate greater than 1 caster level per character level, though they could still take advantage of things like the incanter's sphere specialization.
    
5. A gestalt character who progresses spheres of might classes on both progressions combines their combat talent advancements from their respective classes. This functions as follows. Characters who take two proficient practitioner classes, now gain 1 talent each level. Characters who take one adept practitioner class, as well as one low practitioner class now gain 1 talent each level, as well as one additional talent at level 4 and every four levels thereafter. Characters who take two adept practitioner classes, two expert practitioner classes, or an expert practitioner class and a low practitioner class, now gain 1 talent each level, as well as one additional talent at level 1 and every odd level thereafter. This is demonstrated on the chart below for simplicity. Any specific bonus talents granted by classes are still granted, such as the talents granted by the Bare Knuckles feature of the Striker or the bonus talents class feature of the Conscript. These bonus talents are excluded from any limitations regarding how many talents a character can earn per level. 
    

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Level|Proficient + Proficient|Adept + Adept|Adept + Adept<br><br>Adept + Expert<br><br>Proficient + Expert<br><br>Expert + Expert|
|1|1 (Plus Martial Tradition)|1 (Plus Martial Tradition)|2 (Plus Martial Tradition)|
|2|1|1|1|
|3|1|1|2|
|4|1|2|1|
|5|1|1|2|
|6|1|1|1|
|7|1|1|2|
|8|1|2|1|
|9|1|1|2|
|10|1|1|1|
|11|1|1|2|
|12|1|2|1|
|13|1|1|2|
|14|1|1|1|
|15|1|1|2|
|16|1|2|1|
|17|1|1|2|
|18|1|1|1|
|19|1|1|2|
|20|1|2|1|

5. A gestalt character who progresses either Spheres of Might or Spheres of Power on both progressions with either or both progressions operating as a Champion of the Spheres gain their blended training talents as normal. However, they may not use blended training talents to select a given type of talent, if that selection would raise the number of talents gained from leveling to more than 3 talents gained 2 levels. For example, a striker/crimson dancer could select a combat talent with blended training at level one or level two, but could not select a combat talent using blended training at both levels without exceeding the limit. Bonus talents gained from class features, drawbacks, and casting traditions, are exempt from this limitation, this applies only to talents gained via leveling in a Practitioning or Spherecasting class alongside a Champion of the Spheres class.
    

Gestalt Multiclassing Rules

A gestalt character must choose one of two multiclassing rulesets at level one. Once chosen, this choice is locked in and may not be changed without explicit GM approval. This choice should be notated on your character sheet.

1. Gestalt Multiclassing Variant A:
    

2. A gestalt character using multiclassing Variant A may only multiclass on one of their gestalt paths. The other path may only take levels in the class they took at level one, or in one prestige class, for their entire character progression.. 
    
3. Gestalt characters using multiclassing Variant A may choose from TWO of the listed bullet points in the Allowed Sources section without prior approval from a GM.
    

4. Gestalt Mutliclassing Variant B: 
    

5. A gestalt character using multiclassing Variant B may only choose ONE of the listed bullet points in the Allowed Sources section without prior approval from a GM. 
    
6. A gestalt character using multiclassing Variant B may multiclass on both sides of their gestalt. 
    

## Multiclassing

If you gain a class feature from multiple sources that are otherwise identical in their mechanism, such as Channel Energy or Sneak Attack, levels in those classes stack for the purpose of that class feature, to a maximum of your total character level. Items, feats, and other such abilities may increase your effective class level beyond this limit. For example, a character who was a level 10 gestalt character with both 6 levels of cleric and 7 levels of life oracle between their gestalt paths would only channel energy as a 10th level cleric; however, a Phylactery of Positive Channeling could still increase their effective channel dice. If you have doubts about how a specific ability interacts with these rules, please consult a GM.

  

 If a class feature allows the character to make a one-time choice (such as a bloodline), that choice must match similar choices made by the parent classes and vice-versa (such as selecting the same bloodline), unless it is not possible within the granting class.

  

If you gain the same class feature that utilizes two different attributes to determine its abilities, such as a Ninja’s Ki Pool and a Monk’s Ki Pool, you may choose which attribute to use from the granted class features. Once selected, this option cannot be changed. 

  

For class features with limited uses per day, such as Channel Energy, Ki Pools, and Tactician, for each additional source you have for the base ability, you gain one additional use per day of that ability.

  

Exceptions to this are below:

  

Animal Companions: Effective Druid Levels from all sources stack beyond your character level for the purpose of determining the abilities of animal companions, however you may not possess an animal companion with HD greater than your character level +1. Effective druid levels assigned to an animal companion beyond this point are considered wasted, and the companion gains no benefit from them. Additional effective druid levels beyond this limit may be assigned to additional animal companions; however, this may only be done if you have gained the ability to have multiple companions from a class feature.

  

Sneak Attack: Characters that gain sneak attack from multiple sources may only have a number of sneak attack dice equal to 1 + 1/2 their character level (minimum 1). Sap Master still allows additional sneak attack dice beyond this limit.

  

Multiclassing Binders: 

Pact magic is significantly easier than other types of training and as a result, multiclass binders function differently than other multiclass characters. The following rules govern how multiclass binders determine their binder level, maximum spirit level, and which spirits they can seal pacts with.

Binder Level: A binder’s level is equal to her total levels in all pact magic classes. A pact magic class is any class that grants the bind spirit class feature. For example, a character with two levels of pactmaker and two levels of the warbinder fighter archetype has an effective binder level of 4th. In addition, a binder adds half of her total levels in all other classes to her binder level. For example, a character with two levels of pactmaker and two levels of fighter has an effective binder level of 3rd. This does not gain the binder any other benefits of an increased class level, such as additional spells per day for a wizard or additional pact augmentations for a pactmaker. A character with the Amateur Pactmaker feat possesses no levels in pact magic classes, so her binder level is equal to half of her class level.

Additional Spirits: A multiclass binder may only seal a pact with one spirit at a time, even if she possesses levels in multiple pact magic classes. The only way to gain the ability to seal a pact with multiple spirits simultaneously is to gain the pactmaker’s bind additional spirit class feature, the Reserve Spirit feat, or a similar ability.

Maximum Spirit Level: A binder’s maximum spirit level is determined by taking the highest level of her Pact Magic classes and adding ½ the level of her other classes, even if they are Pact Magic classes. For example, a character with five levels of pactmaker and four levels of the warbinder fighter archetype and a character with four levels of Oracle would both have a maximum spirit level of fourth-level. Although, they would have an effective binder level of 9th.

Barred Spirits or Constellations: Some class features, such as the tunneled lore class feature, can end up restricting which spirits that the pactmaker can seal pacts with. If a multiclass binder possesses levels in multiple classes that bar spirits by constellation, she must take the worse restriction. For example, the pactmaker base class is less restrictive than the warbinder fighter archetype because the pactmaker bars no constellations while the warbinder bars all constellations save for one of the warbinder’s choice. Furthermore, the war-binder is less restrictive than the occult sadist inquisitor archetype, as the latter bars all constellations save for one, specific constellation (the fiend constellation). So, for instance, a multiclass pactmaker/warbinder would use the warbinder’s tunneled lore class feature to determine what spirits the character can seal pacts with while a multiclass warbinder/occult sadist would use the occult sadist’s lore of pain class feature. If the pactmaker has levels in a class that restricts spirits by alignment, favored ally, favored enemy, or vestigial bond, she must adhere to all of these restrictions in addition to constellations that she has barred.

## Background skills

This server uses the Background Skills variant skill system. All characters gain an additional 2 skill ranks per level, which must be spent on background skills. Skill ranks gained normally can also be spent on background skills if so desired.

## Hero Points

Hero Points are only awarded to player characters. NPCs, animal companions, familiars, cohorts, and mounts do not receive hero points. Unlike other points in the game, hero points do not renew over time or with rest. Once spent, they are gone forever. Hero Points are awarded as a character gains levels or whenever a character accomplishes a truly heroic feat.

  

Each character begins play with 1 hero point, regardless of her level. In addition, whenever a character gains a level, she earns an additional hero point. In addition to these, characters may be granted additional hero points by the GM for particularly noteworthy, exceptional, or heroic acts. A character may have no more hero points than 3+¼ their total character level at any time. Excess hero points gained beyond the maximum are lost. A given character may not spend more than 3 hero points in any one encounter.

## Antiheroes

A PC can elect not to use the hero point system, instead relying more on his skills and abilities. Such characters do not receive hero points, regardless of the source, and can never benefit from their use. In exchange, such characters receive a bonus feat at 1st level, 8th level, and 16th level.

## Variant Multiclassing Variant System

Characters who choose Variant Multiclassing can select from two Character Advancement Paths. Characters who select Variant Multiclasses sacrifice their 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level feats, whether they opt to gain abilities from one or two variant multiclasses. Once chosen, these cannot be changed. Classes are distinguished as First Choice Class and Second Choice Class. The First Choice Class gains its respective class features at 2nd level and every 4 levels thereafter. The Second Choice Class gains its abilities at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This is shown on the progression chart below. In addition to the normal variant multiclassing options, the options included in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR7BVLIgGxuJ6pltjytOFx75NalNNsi21XwuvA8YzY-GIY--85bSDptHcdVyIx_rxfRsT5KoJig6VtX/pub) are also allowed.

## Mythic Heroes

Home rules for gaining and wielding Mythic power can be found in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQZbS0eQ1kj5KzF0FRMzstTsqgawGTrI5WsoZtmY8cw3_yNhgrvEFIICMUWuE08lH9K6BXVCHA66452/pub):

## Oaths

Characters may choose to select [Oaths](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/oaths) to follow in order to gain boons.These will be treated as equivalent to a Paladin’s code of conduct, and players determined by a GM to be violating their oaths will lose access to their respective Boons. Oath selection must be approved by a GM and fit in with a character’s overall motivations. In order to grant points towards gaining Oath Boons, a character must take the full penalty of their Oath. A character who mitigates their Oath by any means other than abandoning their oath still loses the points and respective Oath Boons.

  

## Organizations, Fame and Prestige

Players may now participate in the Fame and Prestige system by joining one or more Organizations. This is not required for any character, but the rules for this are laid out in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRxrrEm_p-9hHQggV1MiK4KRVdar5fO1OfD4VACWqwXpkNVwCUCO1VHtLzuHI_F6CRz85LZvoLm_gQo/pub). A character may choose to begin play as a member of one listed organization, bypassing the entrance fee and examination. They must still pay dues at the end of their first month of play if they choose this option. 

  

Characters who are already in play at the time this is added to the rules may choose one organization that they would like to join for free, bypassing the entrance fee and entrance exam, and gaining Fame and Prestige equal to 3 x their total character level.

## Automatic Bonus Progression

Characters may choose to opt into the [Automatic Bonus Progression](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/unchained-rules/automatic-bonus-progression/) Variant Rule System. Doing so reduces the amount of gold they gain automatically upon gaining a new level by 1/2 (rounded down to the nearest gp).

  

Weapon Enhancement Bonuses from ABP are added to all weapons you are wielding, and no longer need to be taken separately for main hand and off-hand weapons.

  

Animal companions, Eidolons, and other comparable companions may also gain the benefits of Automatic Bonus Progression, but they gain benefits as though they were the level of their master -5.

## Automatic Bonus Feats and Feat Adjustments (EITR Variant System)

Some of the listed changes will grant certain feats for free after certain qualifications are met. If these feats are taken prior to those qualifications being met, the prior feat may be retrained immediately once the feat has been granted for free, and without spending downtime. The intention of this is not to increase the overall power of the character, but rather to decrease the cost of certain investments, allowing the character to place greater investment on places where they typically would not. 

  

If you would gain multiple feats that have now been converted into a singular feat, you instead gain the altered single feat, plus an additional bonus feat that uses one of the gained feats as a prerequisite (for example, a Blacksmith gaining the Durable Smithing Insight would gain Toughness* and then one feat that uses either Toughness or Endurance as prerequisites). If no feats exist that your character can take that use those feats as a prerequisite, you may instead gain one Combat Feat or your choice of Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, or Great Fortitude.

  

Acrobatic Steps is now immediately granted to all creatures with Dexterity 15, the Nimble moves feat, and a base attack bonus of +3 or higher.

  

Arcane Armor Training and Arcane Armor Mastery no longer require a swift action to activate each round. Arcane Armor Mastery is granted for free to any creature who meets all of its prerequisites.

  

Armor Focus now grants it benefits to all types of armor covered by that proficiency (Light, Medium, Heavy, Shields). Upon reaching base attack bonus +6, Characters with this feat automatically gain Improved Armor Focus

  

[Cantrips](http://spheresofpower.wikidot.com/general-feats#toc9) and Improved Cantrips are now granted as a bonus feat to all characters with a caster level of +1 or higher

  

Catch Off-Guard and Throw-Anything are now one feat, titled Catch Off-Guard, which grants the benefits of both feats. Any Class that granted one of the old feats as a bonus feat now grants the new combined feat. This feat is granted for free to all creatures upon reaching BaB +4

  

Cleave may now be used when charging or spring attacking. Great Cleave may not be used in this way.

  

Combat Stamina is granted as a bonus feat to all characters upon reaching +1 base attack bonus.

  

Deific Obedience. A character with this feat may choose between the Evangelist, Exalted, and Sentinel boons. This choice is made when the feat is taken, and cannot be changed. They gain the first boon at 7 HD, the second boon at 11 HD, and the third boon at 15 HD. Fey Obedience, Damned Obedience, and other Obedience feats also make no distinction any longer between this feat and themselves. Select the entity you worship when you select the feat and gain the boons accordingly. There is not cause for 6+ identical feats with different names depending on the entities chosen.

  

Fleet and Run are now one feat, granting the benefits of both, referred to as Fleet.

  

Improved Bull Rush, Improved Drag, Improved Grapple, Improved Overrun, and Improved Sunder are now one feat, titled Powerful Maneuvers. This confers the benefits of all five feats and counts towards the prerequisites for any feat that the original feats would count towards. The prerequisites for this feat are Str 13 and Base Attack Bonus +1, or Base Attack Bonus +4. Any creature that obtains one of the listed feats from a bonus feat or class feature gains Powerful Maneuvers instead. This feat is granted for free to all creatures upon reaching BAB +10 and Strength 13. 

  

Greater Bull Rush, Greater Drag, Greater Grapple, Greater Overrun, and Greater Sunder are now one feat, titled Greater Powerful Maneuvers. This confers the benefits of all five feats and counts towards the prerequisites for any feat that the original feats would count towards. The prerequisites for this feat are Powerful Maneuvers and BAB +8. The individual feats of Greater [maneuver] may be taken at BAB +6, and will automatically retrain, becoming Greater Powerful Maneuvers, once the creature reaches BAB+8, with any extra feat slots becoming free again. (e.g. A single classed fighter took Greater Overrun at level 6 and Greater Sunder at level 7. At level 8, Greater Overrun becomes Greater Powerful Maneuvers, and he can reselect his level 7 feat.). This feat is granted for free to any creature with BAB+16, Str 13, and Powerful Maneuvers

  

Improved Dirty Trick, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Reposition, Improved Steal and Improved Trip are now one feat, titled Deft Maneuvers. This confers the benefits of all six feats and counts towards the prerequisites for any feat that the original feats would count towards. The prerequisites for this feat are Int 13 and Base Attack Bonus +1, or Base Attack Bonus +4.

Greater Dirty Trick, Greater Disarm, Greater Feint, Greater Reposition, Greater Steal, and Greater Trip are now one feat, titled Greater Deft Maneuvers.

The prerequisites for this feat are Deft Maneuvers and BAB +8. The individual feats of Greater [maneuver] may be taken at BAB +6, and will automatically retrain at BAB+8, with any extra feat slots becoming free again. (e.g. A fighter took Greater Disarm at level 6 and Greater Trip at level 7. At level 8, Greater Disarm becomes Greater Deft Maneuvers, and he can reselect his level 7 feat.). This feat is granted for free to any creature with BAB+16, Int 13, and Deft Maneuvers

Style feats are now all single feats representing their entire feat chain, which immediately grant the later feats in the chain as bonus feats once the prerequisites for the later feats have been met. (e.g. Boar style can be taken by anyone with improved unarmed strike and 3 ranks of intimidate. You immediately gain the benefits of Boar Ferocity once you have 6 ranks in Intimidate.) If a successive Style Feat has no prerequisites that are not met immediately by possessing the previous Style Feat, you instead gain it 2 levels after obtaining the previous Style Feat. This will only ever grant two bonus feats, and only the clear successor feats. If there is any doubt about which feats will be granted or when, please ask a GM for clarification.

  

Characters using style feats are now assumed to enter one style of their choice upon rolling initiative, and no longer have to spend an action to enter their first style in combat.

  

Toughness, Endurance, and Diehard are now one feat, titled Toughness. Characters who gain one of these feats from any source are treated as having all three.

  

Two-Weapon Fighting is still three feats, but they now function with the following changes: (Monk and Brawler use the original version of the feats unless they take the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat at BAB +11)

Two-Weapon Fighting: Now has a Dexterity prerequisite of 13, rather than 15.

Improved Two-Weapon Fighting: Now has a Dexterity prerequisite of 15, rather than 17. You may now make iterative attacks with your off-hand weapon as though it was a main-hand weapon. You suffer attack roll penalties on these attacks as normal. This is granted automatically to any character with Two-Weapon Fighting, Dexterity 17, and a BAB of +11.

  

Greater Two-Weapon Fighting: Now has a Dexterity prerequisite of 17, rather than 19. You no longer suffer attack roll penalties due to wielding a weapon in your off hand. However, you still suffer penalties from other sources as normal.This is granted automatically to any character with Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting Dexterity 19, and a BAB of +16.

  

Team Up is now immediately granted to all creatures which possess both Gang Up and a base attack bonus of +10.

  

Underwater Basketweaving: All characters are now granted the Underwater Basketweaving talent from Spheres of Guile as soon as they possess 3 ranks in 3 different Craft Skills. They no longer require the Artifice Sphere to take this talent. Receiving this talent this way does not grant the Artifice sphere nor does it count as a talent possessed within the Artifice Sphere for other effects.

  

Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike and Greater Vital Strike are now a single feat, called Vital Strike. The initial prerequisites for this feat are BAB +6. At BAB +11, this automatically grants Improved Vital Strike. At BAB + 16, this automatically grants Greater Vital Strike. Additionally, Vital Strike may now be used while spring attacking or charging.

  

Weapon Finesse and Agile Maneuvers are now a single feat, titled Weapon Finesse, which is granted for free to all creatures with Dexterity of 13 or higher. In addition, Weapon Finesse can now be used with all light weapons, in addition to all other weapons in the Close, Light Blades, Heavy Blades, Monk, and Spears Fighter Weapon Groups, with the exception of bastard sword, falchion, flambard, great terbutje, greatsword, nine-ring broadsword, nodachi, orc skull ram, scythe, and seven-branched sword. Other weapons may be justified when presented. 

  

Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, and Greater Weapon Focus, along with any other feat that requires you to choose a single weapon to which it applies will instead now apply to all weapons in that fighter weapon group, even if the wielder is not a fighter.

## Downtime

This server uses [downtime](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/downtime) rules. Time available for downtime passes in realtime, and players must log their downtime activities. Players may log up to one week of downtime at a time. Each week on Monday morning at 12:00 AM PST, the calendar for downtime resets, and players may begin logging their next week of downtime. Downtime not spent the previous week is lost. At a GM’s discretion a player may receive an opportunity to recover or spend additional downtime, however this is not typical.

  

Characters are allowed up to 1 month of downtime activities prior to their character’s entry into the world, should they choose to take advantage of this time. This time may not be used for XP training. They must still use their starting wealth for any investments in this system.

### Travel

#### International Airship Travel

Characters may travel around Golarion via Airship. In player created kingdoms, an Airship Hangar improvement must be created before airship travel can be used in this way. Cities in kingdoms that are not managed by players, which possess a population of at least 9,000 are assumed to have an Airship Hangar where a player can board an airship. Riding an airship costs 25gp per person, with additional charges to be levied for excessive freight over 200 lbs per person.

  

Airships travel at a cruising speed of 45 mph and fly through the night, allowing them to travel a maximum of 1000 miles in a 24 hour period, including loading and unloading times. For example, this allows travelling from any location in Avistan to any other location in Avistan within a day. But travel from Avistan to Tian Xia would take three to four days, depending on locations.

#### Seeking Travel

Once per week, each character may engage in a one directional teleport to any other place on Golarion where another player character is located. If no player characters are located in that location, players must travel to that location via overland travel, airship travel, or via purchasing spellcasting services.

#### Magical Abilities Which Aid in Travel

There are some services that characters may purchase in order to aid in travel. A portion of them are listed below, with their respective costs.

### Training and Retraining

Characters may spend downtime to retrain character options that they have chosen at respective levels, retraining character options can sometimes open up particularly powerful combinations that are not possible without retraining. As such, GMs must be alerted to retraining when you do so in your Downtime, although you do not expressly need to wait for approval unless otherwise stated under that retraining option.

  

Retraining takes all your attention for 8 hours per day for a number of days based on what you’re retraining. You can’t perform any other strenuous activities while retraining, such as marching, adventuring, or crafting magic items. You can retrain only one thing at a time; you must complete or abandon a particular retraining goal before starting another one. Abandoning unfinished training means you lose all progress toward that training’s goal and all costs associated with that training.

  

Some kinds of training can be done simultaneously with other downtime activities, such as crafting, capital businesses, day job checks. Even when this is allowed, these can not be done simultaneously with other training or retraining activities.

  

When you use retraining to replace some aspect of your character, you must meet all prerequisites, requirements, and considerations for whatever you’re trying to acquire. For example, a 6th-level rogue can’t use retraining to learn the Weapon Specialization feat because only fighters can choose that feat. When retraining multiple character options (class features, feats, classes, etc.) in one continuous period, all of the new selections are made at the end of that period in an order decided by the player. If this period is interrupted for any reason all choices must be made immediately. In this way players can retrain class features and their prerequisites at the same time.

  

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Training Option|Days Required|Concurrent with other Downtime Activities|
|Ability Score Increase|4|No|
|Archetype|3|No|
|Base Ability Scores|varies|No|
|Class Feature|3|No|
|Class Level|7|No|
|Experience Training|1|Day Job Only|
|Feat|4|No|
|Hit Point Training|4|Yes|
|Learn a Language|20|Yes|
|POW Maneuvers/Disciplines|Varies|No|
|Racial Trait|20|Yes|
|Occult Ritual Research|Varies|Yes|
|Skill Ranks|2|No|
|Spell, Power, or Veil Known|Varies|No|
|Spell, Power, or Veil Research|Varies|Yes|
|Trait|2|No|
|Train an Animal|Varies|Only if Using Trainer|

#### Ability Score Increase

You may retrain an ability score increase gained at level 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20. This takes 4 days. At the end of the training period, remove the +1 bonus from the original ability score and add it to a different ability score. If this retraining means you no longer qualify for a feat, prestige class, or other ability you have, you can’t use that feat, prestige class, or ability until you meet the qualifications again. (You can retrain that feat, prestige class, or other ability separately.)

#### Archetype

You can use the retraining rules to acquire an archetype for your class or abandon an archetype you have.

  

To gain an archetype that replaces standard class abilities you already have, you must spend 3 days for every alternate class feature you would add, subtract, or replace by taking that archetype. At the end of the training period, you lose the standard class features and replace them with the archetype’s alternate class features (if any).

  

To abandon an archetype, you must spend 5 days for every alternate class feature you already have from that archetype. At the end of the retraining, you lose the archetype’s class features and gain the standard class features for the class.

  

Swapping one archetype for another may be done in the same retraining sessions

  

#### Base Ability Scores

Retraining the base ability scores of a character may alter fundamental aspects of a character. As such, it is not to be undertaken lightly and requires GM approval. 

  

The target ability scores are determined, and then you must spend one week for every point that is gained or lost. The new results must achieve the same Point Buy Value. For example, Jabitha wishes to reduce her 15 in Wisdom to a 14 and increase her Charisma from a 14 to a 15. This will take her a total of 10 days of retraining, five of which to reduce her Wisdom, and five to increase her Charisma.

  

If retraining your ability scores means you no longer qualify for a feat or other ability you have, you can’t use that feat or ability until you meet the qualifications again. (Or you can retrain that feat or other ability.)

#### Class Feature

Many choices you make about your class features can be retrained. It takes 5 days to retrain one class feature. Training requires spending time with a character of your class whose class level is at least 1 higher than yours and who has the class feature you want. For example, if you are a 5th-level illusionist wizard and want to become a necromancer, you must train with a necromancer of at least 6th level.

  

Retraining a class feature means you lose the old class feature and gain a new one that you could otherwise qualify for at that point in your level advancement. For example, if you want to retrain your paladin’s fatigued mercy (which she gained at 3rd level), you can replace it only with another mercy from the 3rd-level list. If at 6th level you learned the sickened mercy (which is on the 3rd-level list), you may replace it with a mercy from the 3rd- or 6th-level list (because you are replacing a 6th-level mercy slot which you spent on a 3rd-level mercy).

  

The class feature you wish to retrain can’t be one that you used as a prerequisite for a feat, class feature, archetype, prestige class, or other ability. You must retrain those elements separately before you can retrain this class feature.

  

If an archetype or variant class feature replaces the listed class feature, at the GM’s discretion you may retrain that alternative class feature for an equivalent variant class feature. For example, Ultimate Magic presents rules for inquisitions, which inquisitors can select in place of a domain, and the inquisitor entry below allows you to retrain your chosen domain, so you are allowed to instead retrain an inquisition, swapping it for a domain or another inquisition.

#### Class Level

One of the most critical choices you can make about your character is what class to choose when you gain a level.

  

In general, it takes 7 days to retrain one level in a class into one level in another class. When you retrain a class level, you lose all the benefits of the highest level you have in that class. You immediately select a different class, add a level in that class, and gain all the benefits of that new class level.

  

This retraining does not allow you to reselect the feats your character gains at odd levels or the ability score increases your character gains every four levels (though you can retrain those options separately). If retraining a class level means you no longer qualify for a feat, prestige class, or other ability you have, you can’t use that feat, prestige class, or ability until you meet the qualifications again.

#### Feat

You may change one feat to another through retraining. Retraining a feat takes 5 days with a character who has the feat you want. The old feat can’t be one you used as a prerequisite for a feat, class feature, archetype, prestige class, or other ability. If the old feat is a bonus feat granted by a class feature, you must replace it with a feat that you could choose using that class feature.

  

Note that this retraining is unrelated to the fighter ability to learn a new bonus feat in place of an old one at certain class levels. That class ability is free, happens instantly when the character gains an appropriate fighter level and can happen only once for any appropriate fighter level. Retraining a feat takes time and can happen as often as you want.

#### Experience Training

You can spend downtime adventuring in order to earn experience. Usually downtime adventures feature encounters that are much easier than you’d normally expect as part of a group. Spending 1 day of downtime adventuring earns you XP as if you had defeated an opponent whose CR was equal to your character level, per the chart below. This may make up no more than 3 days of downtime per week.

  

Characters who do Experience Training may choose to roll a Day Job check on the same day as part of their Downtime checks.

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Level|EXP|
|1|400|
|2|600|
|3|800|
|4|1,200|
|5|1,600|
|6|2,400|
|7|3,200|
|8|4,800|
|9|6,400|
|10|9,600|
|11|12,800|
|12|19,200|
|13|25,600|
|14|38,400|
|15|51,200|
|16|76,800|
|17|102,400|
|18|153,600|
|19|204,800|
|20|307,200|

#### Hit Point Training

Unlike retraining other character abilities, retraining hit points doesn’t involve replacing an existing ability with a new one, it just increases your maximum hit points.

  

Retraining hit points takes 4 days and requires you to spend time at a martial academy, monk monastery, or with some kind of master of combat who is at least one level higher than you. At the end of the training period, increase your hit points by 1. You can retrain hit points only if your maximum hit point total is less than the maximum possible hit point total for your character.

#### Learning a Language

You can spend time to learn an additional language. It takes 20 days of training to gain a bonus language, and these days need not be consecutive. Each language requires a trainer who shares a language with you and knows the language you want to learn, or a book written in a language you know that explains the basics of the language you want to learn.

  

The new language does not count toward your typical maximum number of languages. You may only train this way a number of times equal to 1+ your intelligence bonus (minimum 1)

#### Path of War Maneuvers or Disciplines

Initiators can retrain their known maneuvers and stances; this retraining takes 1 day per level of the new maneuver. The new maneuver or stance must be part of the initiator’s available disciplines for the class, and must be of an equal or lower level to the maneuver or stance it replaces. Note that this is unrelated to the ability of initiators to swap maneuvers for higher-level ones at certain initiator levels; that swap represents the initiator’s evolving style of combat, does not require a trainer, cannot replace stances, and can happen only once at a given level.

  

If an Initiator wishes to retrain one of their available disciplines for another discipline that they have the option to exchange a discipline for, they must first retrain all maneuvers and stances out of the discipline that they intend to forsake. Once this is done, they may retrain to a new available discipline by spending two weeks of non-consecutive time. After this point, they may retrain maneuvers or stances into the new discipline.

#### Racial Trait

You may choose to retrain a racial trait. This takes 20 nonconsecutive days. The replacement trait must be an appropriate one from your racial list. You may choose to simply replace an alternate racial trait with the original racial trait that it replaced, or exchange it for a separate alternate racial trait. If you choose to exchange it for a separate alternate racial trait, that may be done in the same training period, but they must replace the same racial trait.

#### Replace Your Animal Companion

If you lose or dismiss your animal companion, you can spend 1 day performing a ceremony to gain a new one. This ceremony requires 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives

#### Replace Your Familiar

The standard rules allow you to replace a familiar if at least 1 week has passed since it was dismissed or lost. Doing so requires you to spend 1 day performing a specialized ritual to summon a new familiar. The ritual costs 200 gp × your spellcaster level. You can spend Capital toward the ritual cost.

#### Research an Occult Ritual

The mysteries of occult rituals are jealously guarded secrets, often painstakingly obscured by a ritual’s originators or those who stumbled upon the obscure formulae detailing it. The particulars of casting occult rituals are hidden within coded tomes, concealed in puzzles, or referenced only through allusions woven into esoteric tales. Recovering the casting method of an occult ritual can be an adventure within itself, something revealed by hallucinatory visions, coerced from an occult practitioner, or passed on by a true initiate hovering at death’s door and wishing for his genius to live beyond his mortal existence.

  

The person attempting to learn the ritual may make a Knowledge (Local) check to attempt to find a willing teacher. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + double the level of the ritual. Failing this check by less than 5 finds someone who knows the ritual, but is not eager to pass on the knowledge.

  

If a book is found which contains details of an occult ritual, treat possession of this text as having an uneager teacher for that ritual, no matter the quality of the text.

  

If an occult ritual is taught or its secrets are explained directly, it takes at least 1 day per ritual level to learn the method of its casting. Learning a ritual from hidden clues or from scratch takes a week per ritual level. At the end of this period of study and contemplation, the person attempting to learn the ritual must succeed at an Intelligence check (DC = 15 + the ritual level if learning from clues or an uneager teacher, or DC = 10 + the ritual level if learning from an instructor eager to teach). Failing the check means the secrets of the ritual elude the learner’s understanding, though she can start the process anew at the same rate of potential discovery.

  

The process of attempting to learn an occult ritual costs 1,000gp per level of the ritual, regardless of the success of the attempt. If the learner fails, they must pay this price again to attempt a second time.

#### Skill Ranks

You can retrain skill ranks you have assigned to skills. Retraining skill ranks takes 2 days. When the training period ends, reassign a number of skill ranks up to the maximum of your Intelligence bonus or Class Level (minimum 1), removing them from your existing skill (or skills) and adding them to a different skill (or skills).

  

If retraining skill ranks means you no longer qualify for a feat or other ability you have, you can’t use that feat or ability until you meet the qualifications again. (Or you can retrain that feat or other ability.)

#### Spells or Powers Known

If you are a spontaneous spellcaster (such as a bard, oracle, sorcerer, or summoner), you can retrain a spell known. This retraining takes 2 days per spell level of the new spell (or 1 day in the case of a cantrip or orison) and requires a trainer who can cast the spell you want. The trainer must cast the same kind of spells as you do (arcane or divine).

  

The spell with which you’re replacing the previous spell must be another from your class spell list. The new spell must be one you could place in the old spell’s spell slot. Note that this retraining is unrelated to the ability of sorcerers (or other spontaneous spellcasters) to learn a new spell in place of an old one at certain class levels. That class ability is free, happens instantly when the character gains an appropriate level in the spellcasting class, doesn’t require a trainer, and can happen only once for any appropriate class level. Retraining a spell known requires you to spend gp, takes time, requires a trainer, and can happen as often as you want.

#### Spell, Power, or Veil Research

A character may choose to research a spell or power in order to add it to their classes spell/power/veil list. This may either duplicate an existing spell or creating an entirely new one. The cost to research a new ability, whether that specific ability is able to be researched, and the time required, are left up to GM discretion and must be decided before the research begins. 

When researching a spell or power, this will always take at least 1 week and cost at least 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be researched. When researching a veil this takes five weeks and costs 10,000 gp. Successfully researching a spell requires a Spellcraft check at the end of each week equal DC 25+ spell level. 

#### Sphere Talent

A character may choose to retrain talents from a Spheres Origin, Spheres of Might, Spheres of Power, or a Trade Tradition. This takes three days for each talent retrained. If retraining this talent means you no longer qualify for another ability, you may no longer use that ability until the talent is regained, although you may also choose to retrain out of that ability.

#### Train an Animal

You can use the Handle Animal skill to train an animal. The rules for training assume the training period is continuous. However, you can break this training into smaller increments (allowing you to make progress on this training between adventures), but you must attempt a Handle Animal check for each training period, and the DC increases by 2. Failing the check means that training period doesn’t count toward completing the training.

  

Training an animal requires 2 hours each day and does not prevent a character from engaging in other Downtime activities.

  

While an animal gained through class features often gains bonus tricks that do not require taking the time to train, animals can learn any number of tricks, if their handler takes the time to teach them adequately.

  

You may hire a skilled animal trainer to train an animal on your behalf. This allows the training to take place alongside all other downtime activities. Animal trainers can be hired at 2gp per day for every +1 bonus the trainer has in the skill, to a maximum of +10.

##### Teach an Animal a Trick

This requires 7 days and a successful Handle Animal check at the end of the training period. You may spend a point of Capital to modify your check result, with each 1 point of capital adding 1 to your total (maximum +10). A list of specific tricks and their DCs can be found [here](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal)

##### Train an Animal for a General Purpose

This sort of training can take several weeks, depending on the nature of the training. You may spend Capital to modify your check result, with every point of capital adding 1 to your total (maximum +10). An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time. General Purposes and their DCs can be found [here](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal)

##### Rear a Wild Animal

Depending on the maturation rate of the animal, this can take anywhere from weeks to months or even years. For simplicity’s sake, interacting with the animal for an hour per day in a safe environment counts toward this training and doesn’t require you to spend any downtime. As long as you maintain this daily contact, you need to succeed at only one Handle Animal check at the end of the rearing period. An interruption requires you to succeed at a check to continue the rearing (you may attempt this check once per day). The assumption is that you have a non-expert taking care of the animal’s basic needs while you are away so it isn’t neglected. If you know you will miss a day of this contact, you may spend 2 Capital or pay 20 gp for each missed day to have a skilled animal handler rear the animal for the day, meaning your absence doesn’t count as an interruption in the animal’s training.

#### Trait or Drawback

You may change one trait or drawback to another through retraining. Retraining such a trait or drawback takes 2 days. The old trait can’t be one you used as a prerequisite for a feat, class feature, archetype, prestige class, or other ability. 

#### Magical Abilities Which Aid In Training and Retraining

There are some services that characters may purchase in order to save time associated with retraining or training. Spells, powers, and other abilities which may be used to aid in training and retraining, along with their associated costs are listed below:

### Crafting

This server utilizes several changes to crafting rules. These are intended to encourage a player economy where players can seek out items crafted by other players. Crafting time is counted out of a players available downtime at a rate of 1 day–1 day. Time spent crafting cannot also be used for other downtime activities unless otherwise specified.

  

A given character cannot spend more than 8 hours in a day crafting objects, whether they are Mundane or Magical.

  

Capital earned through Downtime may be used in place of the gold investment required to begin making objects for both mundane and magical item crafting at 100% of their normal value.

  

Non-gold currencies that sell at full gold value, such as artwork, gems, and trade goods can be substituted for gold or expensive material components when crafting items.

#### Craft Skills

In order to reduce the complexity and number of one-off uses of unique craft skills in the rules, Craft skills have been condensed into a more limited list of 14 Craft skills, shown below. Each skill lists after it all other Craft Skills whose functions are now included in it.

- Alchemy (alcohol, brewing, distilling, pharmaceutical, poison, wine),
    
- Artistry (bonework, drawing, ice sculpture, lightcraft, lightworking, musical instruments, nightmare, paintings, sculpting, sculptures, stonecarving, toys, puppets, scrimshaw, tattoo, taxidermy, wood sculpture)
    
- Carpentry (bows, ships, shipbuilding, wood, wood carving, wooden buildings, wood working)
    
- Cooking (baked goods, confections, cuisine, food trade goods)
    
- Linguistics (calligraphy, poetry, writing)
    
- Firearms (gunsmithing, firearm, mechanical, siege engines (firearms))
    
- Jewelry (Gemcutting, Glass, Jewelry)
    
- Leatherworking (armor (leather armor), leather, shoes, torture device)
    
- Masonry (crude weapons, pottery, stone buildings, stonemasonry, stone weapons)
    
- Mechanical (construct, clockwork, clocks, clockwork toys, locks, locksmith, siege engines)
    
- Metalworking (armor (metal armor), armorsmithing, blacksmithing, ironworking, goldsmith, metal trade goods, weapons (metal weapons), weaponsmithing (metal weapons), metal tools)
    
- Paperworking (books, bookbinding, cards, cartography, illustration, mapmaking, maps, origami, printing)
    
- Traps (booby trap, mechanical traps, trapmaking)
    
- Weaving (basketweaving, baskets, cloth, cloth armor, clothing, sails, tailor, textiles)
    

#### Mundane Item Crafting

This server uses the below rules for Mundane crafting which overwrite and replace the existing rules for mundane crafting.

  

A character skilled in the creation of a specific group of mundane items, such as armor and weapons, can create them using the rules below. You can have several different Craft skills, each with its own ranks. The most common craft skills are alchemy, armor, baskets, books, bows, calligraphy, carpentry, cloth, clothing, glass, jewelry, leather, locks, paintings, pottery, sculptures, ships, shoes, stonemasonry, traps, and weapons, although others may exist. Craft skills specifically focus on creating something. If any endeavor does not result in a final created product, it likely will utilize a Profession skill.

  

Check: After you have a suitable area to craft and you’ve gathered your tools, you must then acquire raw materials whose value is equal to 1/3 the cost of the item or items you wish to craft. Given the necessary tools, materials, and workspace, you can attempt a Craft check of the appropriate DC to craft the object. If you exceed the DC necessary to craft the item by 5, you double the progress for that day. This rate change lasts for the duration of the time necessary to make the object. 

  

When you are crafting a masterwork item or an item made of a special material, the DC to craft that item increases by 5. If an item is both masterwork and made of a special material, the DC to craft that item increases by 10.

  

If you fail the check, no progress is made that day. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you waste an amount of your raw materials equal to the item’s base progress per day, up to a maximum of the initial cost of the raw materials. Such wasted material must be replenished before you can continue crafting the item.

  

You make 100gp worth of progress each day for the item you are crafting per rank you possess in the relevant Craft skill, before progress speed adjustments. When your total progress equals the cost of the item, that item is completed. Any remaining progress within a day can be applied to a similar item, supplying its initial resource investment cost at the time you begin crafting it; otherwise, all excess progress is lost. A new craft check is not necessary for objects of the same kind made on the same day

  

Setting Aside Crafting Items: As long as you can store an item in a secure and safe place, you can set aside an item that you began crafting and return to it again later with little or no effect. Your GM may rule that this is not possible for specific projects, especially in the case of volatile alchemical items or perishable goods.

Repairing Items: You can use the appropriate Craft skill to repair items of that type. Repairing an item with the broken condition or that has taken damage (or both) requires tools and a work area, and you must pay 1/10 the item’s cost in raw materials. Repairing an item has the same DC as crafting the item, but takes an amount of time based on the item’s complexity. Extremely simple items take an hour to repair. Simple and normal items take 1d4 hours to repair. Complex and intricate items take a day to repair, and all other items take 1d4 days to repair.

Supervising Helpers As stated in both versions of the skill, Craft allows you to supervise untrained laborers. An untrained laborer has no ranks in Craft, but can attempt to aid in the process of creating items with the Craft skill. This is done by first paying the untrained laborer either 1 sp per day or 7 sp for a week’s worth of work. Each untrained worker you hire can attempt to aid another on your Craft check with a +0 bonus (assuming an Intelligence score of 10 or 11 and no ranks in the appropriate Craft skill). Typically, you can hire no more than two artisans to help you craft most small or relatively simple items (such as adventuring gear, alchemical items, armor, poisons, and weapons), but for large and complex items (such as siege engines and vehicles), you can hire as many as 10 untrained laborers to assist you.

  

If your GM allows it and you are in a location where they can be found, you can also hire and supervise trained laborers. These laborers have ranks in the appropriate Craft skill and have a greater chance to aid you in your crafting endeavors. Trained Laborers cost 2gp per day to hire and possess a +6 bonus to the relevant class skill. More skilled laborers may be found at greater cost at GM discretion.

  

Workspace: When crafting items, you need tools and an appropriate workspace. What constitutes an appropriate workspace is often situational. Repairing weapons or armor in the field requires only a relatively quiet and clear area, while crafting a suit of full plate requires a workshop and a forge. Typically, items of normal or greater complexity require a workshop of some sort, but under certain circumstances, the GM can rule that such items can be created in the field. Alchemical items and poisons are exceptions to these guidelines, as their compact nature makes them easier to craft in the field, especially with the help of an alchemist’s lab.

  

Masterwork Workspaces: Large, well-stocked workspaces can also aid in the crafting of items, particularly when you use trained and untrained labor. These masterwork workspaces grant trained and untrained laborers a +2 circumstance bonus on checks to aid another when they aid your Craft check. Furthermore, if a trained or untrained laborer succeeds at the check to aid another by 5 or more, that laborer grants you a +3 bonus on your check instead of the normal +2. It typically costs 5 gp per day to rent a masterwork workspace for crafting relatively small items (such as most adventuring gear, alchemical items, armor, poisons, and weapons) and 20 gp per day to rent a masterwork workspace for creating larger items (such as siege engines and vehicles).

#### Harvesting and Crafting Poisons

While some think of poison as an assassin’s tool, the herbalists and naturalists of the world know that poison carries in it no more inherent evil than fire or water. Indeed, in the wildlands of the world, harvesting poison to give a hunter an edge or to aid in the production of antivenom is a time-honored practice.

  

Poisons may be obtained by harvesting them using Survival, in addition to brewing them using Craft (alchemy). The DC for producing Poisons with Survival is the equal to the DC to produce them with Craft (alchemy). Additionally, Poisons may be optionally crafted at a reduced cost, producing them by providing 1/5 of their purchase price in materials rather than 1/3. However, poisons made in this way are unstable and cannot be sold.

#### Magical Item Crafting

Crafting magical items no longer requires an abundance of specific feats, but rather requires a specific number of ranks of spellcraft and/or other skills. Anyone who meets the listed prerequisites of the chart below is treated as though they have the outlined Item Creation feat. Some crafting feats may require ranks in other skills as well before their benefits become available, as shown below. 

  

If any class or ability grants a magical item crafting feat from this list as a bonus feat, and you do not qualify for it using the means outlined in this chart, you still gain access to that feat. However, this does not grant any of the prerequisite skill ranks. At the point at which you qualify for that feat using the means outlined in the chart, you may immediately retrain that feat into another feat you qualify for.

  

If you would like to use a crafting feat introduced by one of the allowed 3pp systems that is not included here, please ask and it will be added to this chart.

  

Other prerequisites of crafting must still be met as normal. The DC to create a magic item increases by +5 for each prerequisite the caster does not meet. The only exception to this is the requisite item creation feat, which must be qualified for. In addition, you cannot create potions, spell-trigger, or spell-completion magic items without meeting their spell prerequisites.

  

Potions can be made out of spells with a target of Personal, although potions made in this way are treated as one level higher for the purposes of crafting. Potions can not be made out of 3rd level spells with a target of Personal.

  

A character with Craft Rod can choose to create a Rod that also functions as a one-handed weapon from the Hammers weapon group at the time of creation. Doing so requires a successful Craft check, in addition to other construction requirements. A Rod created this way can be enhanced as a respective weapon and retain its magical properties.

  

A character with Craft Staff can choose to create a Staff that also functions as a bo staff, crook, quarterstaff or as a weapon from the Spears or Bows weapon groups at the time of creation. Doing so requires a successful Craft check, in addition to other construction requirements. A Staff created this way can be enhanced as a respective weapon and retain its magical properties.

##### Dynamic Magic Item Crafting

When crafting a magic item that costs at minimum 20,000 gp, a character may choose to use the optional [Dynamic Magic Item Creation Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT_Ur4ntqCcTD7VUK7PwypuRyx8j2Vr9RTLHp00vFQ6Ag1c7PBbzYfhtiYLqcboI67Mud0zMIHwba1I/pub).

  

### Earning Gold

#### Day Job

All characters may choose to spend a day of downtime in order to work a day job. If they do so, they may roll a day job check using an appropriate skill bonus. A player may use any skill check to roll a day job check. If a player has a cohort, familiar, animal companion, or other subordinate creature, they may be aided in this check; subject to the aid another limits 

  

|   |   |

|10|15|
|15|30|
|20|50|

|85|765|
|90|855|
|95|950|
|100+|1050|

#### Investments

Characters may choose to place gold into an investment once per week. 

  

Investments have three important measures. A Chance of Failure, a Return on Failure, and a Return on Success.

  

Chance of Failure: This is the chance that an investment does not return an ideal result. At the end of the investment period, the player rolls 1d100. If this roll is within the failure chance range, then the initial investment amount is multiplied by the Return on Failure percentage. Otherwise, the initial investment amount is multiplied by the Return on Success percentage.

  

Return on Failure: This is the amount of the initial investment that the investment returns if the investment result is a failure.

  

Return on Success: This is the amount of the initial investment that the investment returns if the investment result is a success.

  

Investments take one week before they return their results, and their success or failure is not known until after that week. Players may choose to allow them to take additional time to mature in order to reduce risk. For every additional week they take to mature, they reduce their chance of failure by 5%. A given investment may not reduce its chance of failure by more than 10%, or below 5% total chance in this way.

  

Investments are handled entirely by the result of large numbers of NPC businesses and NPC action. As a result, their chances of failure and success may not be predicted or influenced in any way by player abilities.

  

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Risk Level|Chance of Failure|Return on Failure|Return on Success|
|Very Low|1-5|90%|113%|
|Low|1-10|80%|125%|
|Moderate|1-15|70%|138%|
|High|1-20|60%|150%|
|Very High|1-30|40%|175%|

#### Capital Income

Capital is the backbone of the downtime system. Capital is necessary for completing many downtime activities. You can gain Capital in one of two ways: by purchasing it or by earning it.

Capital is an abstraction of goods, items, favors, goodwill in a community, loan opportunities, gold, and other such things. As such, it can not be sold to other players or NPCs, although a player may charge a fee in order to use their own capital on another players behalf. Capital does not decay or degrade in value, but it must be used to have any express value. You may read the full details of the Capital system in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRha7RkcP_X8ZFfkFVxIJijYvua7Tzff4cfFgXHvn5Ety3qXiOlNSj1EkFPx3TjrgLAz8lQZfEoP2lq/pub)

### Kingdom Building

Players are allowed to engage in Kingdom Building. We are using a somewhat modified version of these rules, [which is included HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT53b5BGlHcEqQYMkx1OwqZwW0iHdNJz5bfF8PfWGBADvK4mAcZ1u2Mdo_ItS4r56dOFQ8ueLvlh18f/pub). Players who want to engage in the creation of their own kingdom, should read up on these rules.

  

## Variant Prestige Class progressions

Classes which improve Spells Per day may instead improve spherecasting, manifesting, veilweaving, and pact binding. This operates as described below.

  

If a given class grants multiple options from the list of options, such as the Thug, you may progress both of said options granted using the rules listed below for that option. You may only replace a single Spells Per Day with multiple of the listed options when applying it to a single base class. The effective spell levels for prerequisites from these abilities count as neither arcane nor divine by default. Classes may qualify as arcane or divine if they gain access to specific spell-like abilities or equivalencies, using the same rules for determining arcane or divine listed under spell-like abilities. Classes which rely on deities or reverence to gain their abilities qualify as divine. 

  

Spherecasting: 

Spherecasting classes treat their spherecaster level as their spellcaster level for the purpose of prerequisites. To determine their effective determining Spell Level for prerequisites when using spherecasting, please refer to the chart below. 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Equivalent Spell Level|Spherecaster Level|
|0|1|
|1|2|
|1|3|
|2|4|
|2|5|
|3|6|
|3|7|
|4|8|
|4|9|
|5|10|
|5|11|
|6|12|
|6|13|
|7|14|
|7|15|
|8|16|
|8|17|
|9|18|
|9|19|
|10|20|

  

When gaining Spells Per Day from a prestige class, you may instead choose to use the following text: At levels in which you would gain spells per day from this class, you may instead gain an increased caster level and casting ability progression (new magic talents, spell point progression, etc.) as if you had also gained a level in any one spherecasting class you belonged to before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character with that class would have gained (such as non-casting class abilities). If you had more than one spherecasting class before you took a level in this class, you must decide which class you add each level of the prestige class to for the purpose of determining spherecasting progression.

  

Manifesters:

Manifesters treat their manifester level as their caster level for the purpose of prerequisites. They treat their psionic power levels as the effective spell level for the purpose of prerequisites. Thus, a Marksman who is level 5 would have an effective caster level of 5 and an effective spell level of 2 for the purpose of prerequisites.

When gaining Spells Per Day from a prestige class, you may instead choose to use the following text: At levels in which you would gain spells per day from this class, you may instead gain additional power points per day and access to new powers as if you had also gained a level in whatever manifesting class you belonged to before you added the prestige class. You do not, however, gain any other benefits a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of this prestige class to the level of whatever manifesting class you have, and then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly. If you had more than one manifesting class before you took a level in this class, you must decide to which class you add the new level of this class for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.

  

Veilweaving:

Veilweavers treat their combined level in veilweaving classes as their caster level for the purpose of prerequisites. To determine their effective Spell Level for prerequisites when using veilweaving, please refer to the chart below. A veilweaver must be able to shape both the listed number of veils and have the listed amount of essence to qualify as a given spell level.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Equivalent Spell Level|Veils|Essence|
|1|2|1|

When gaining Spells Per Day from a prestige class, you may instead choose to use the following text: At levels in which you would gain spells per day from this class, you may instead gain new veils shaped, binds, and essence as though he had gained a level in any one veilweaving class you belonged to before you added the prestige class. You do not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one veilweaving class before you took a level in this class, you must decide to which class you add each level of this class for the purpose of determining your veils shaped and binds known.

  

Constellation Manifesters: 

Constellation Manifesters, such as the Zodiac, treat their combined level in constellation manifesting classes as their caster level for the purpose of prerequisites. To determine their effective Spell Level for prerequisites when using constellation manifesters, please refer to the chart below. A constellation manifester must have both the requisite manifester level and the listed essence pool in order to qualify as a given spell level.

  

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Equivalent Spell Level|Manifester level|Essence|
|1|1|1|

When gaining Spells Per Day from a prestige class, you may instead choose to use the following text: At levels in which you would gain spells per day from this class, you may instead gain essence and advance your orbit as though had gained a level in a class which granted the ability to manifest constellations that you belonged to before you added the prestige class. You do not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one constellation manifesting class before you took a level in this class, you must decide to which class you add each level of this class for the purpose of determining your essence gain and orbit advancement.

  

Pact Binders:

Pact Binders treat their binder level as their caster level for the purpose of prerequisites. They treat the Spirit Level of the spirits they bind as an effective spell level for the purpose of prerequisites. Thus, a pactmaker who is level 5, who has a binder level of 5 and a maximum spirit level of 3 would have an equivalent caster level of 3 and would qualify for abilities as though they could cast 3rd level spells.

  

When gaining Spells Per Day from a prestige class, you may instead choose to use the following text: At levels in which you would gain spells per day from this class, you may instead progress your binder level as though you had gained a level in one pact binding class you had belonged to before you added the prestige class. Levels progressed in this way stack with your character’s binder level for all purposes, including binding checks, calculating the effectiveness of granted abilities, and determining the character’s maximum spirit level. If you had more than one pact binding class before you took a level in this class, you must decide to which class you add each level of this class for the purpose of determining your pact binding abilities.

## Martial Traditions (Initiator)

A player with an initiator level may choose to join a martial tradition, replacing one of their martial disciplines with the associated discipline of that tradition and gaining their associated class skill. Characters who choose to use this option do not have to take the tradition's oath and do not gain the tradition's allegiance benefit. In situations where a character may need to reference the regions associated with a Martial Tradition, use the following list. If other Martial Disciplines are approved for use, they will be added to this list.

  

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Absalom|Veiled Moon|Thrashing Dragon|Radiant Dawn|
|Broken Lands|Piercing Thunder|Silver Crane||
|Eye of Dread|Unquiet Grave|Eternal Guardian||

# Rules clarifications

In all circumstances, unless it cannot make sense within the rules text described you are your own ally.

  

Temporary bonuses (Such as enhancement bonuses from items) or abilities granted from temporary sources may be used to qualify for prerequisites as long as you possess them for at least 24 hours contiguously. If you lose these bonuses and no longer would qualify for the the class feature or choice that it was used as a prerequisite for, you lose the benefits of that chosen ability until you once again meet the prerequisites.

  

For all abilities that offer a saving throw, a creature can choose to forgo a saving throw in order to automatically accept the results of a failed save from that ability.

  

All bonuses that come from traits are considered to be trait bonuses and thus do not stack with each other, unless there is a specific other type listed in the trait.

  

Stealth can be performed as a free action during any movement or as a Move action

  

Tinker Sphere effects are all treated as though they have taken Mana Engineering. 

  

Tinker Sphere Inventioneering is handled similar to spell research, in that custom inventions will be proposed to the GMs and have their prices determined based on the nearest equivalency that exists within the rules.

## Magic

All spells and spell-like abilities, even when stilled and silenced, have an obvious magical component to them. This is typically, but not necessarily, visual and may be unique to the caster, but cannot be removed, it may also rely on scent, kinesthesia, proprioception, or any other number of senses. This makes it apparent, although occasionally difficult to detect, that someone is casting a spell as long as their square is within clear line of effect, even if the person casting is otherwise invisible. Players are expected to determine what their explicit magical components are. Spellcraft is usually required to determine what these effects are in order to identify that spellcasting is occurring. This does not always mean that someone can determine what square the magic is originating from, but it does mean that people can typically tell that magic is occurring.

  

Clarification: Spell-like abilities take the same amount of time as the spell they mimic or reference. If they do not explicitly mimic or reference a spell, they take a standard action.

  

Clarification: Spell-like abilities provoke attacks of opportunities following the same rules as spells, and still require concentration checks to cast defensively or when taking damage. Like a spell, it is apparent when someone is casting a spell-like ability. 

  

Spell like abilities count as spells for the purpose of all prerequisites. They are innate abilities rather than trained abilities, but can be used for similar functions. 

  

When a spell-like ability references a specific spell, the creature's spell-like abilities are presumed to be the sorcerer/wizard versions of that spell. If the spell in question is not a sorcerer/wizard spell, then default to cleric/oracle, druid, shaman, witch, psychic, bard, magus, warpriest, summoner, alchemist/investigator, mesmerist, occultist, spiritualist, paladin, ranger, bloodrager, and medium, in that order. This is used for determining the effective spell level of a spell-like ability and whether or not it is arcane or divine.

  

For spell-like abiities gained from a class, use the spell type (arcane or divine) of that class to determine whether the spell-like ability is arcane or divine. If a class on this list casts psychic spells, the spell-like ability is treated as arcane. If the class doesn't cast spells, use the above rule for spell-like abilities from race or type.

## Psionics–Magic Transparency

This server uses the full applications of Psionics-Magic Transparency. This has the following effects.

  

Spell resistance is effective against powers, using the same mechanics. Likewise, power resistance is effective against spells, using the same mechanics as spell resistance. If a creature has one kind of resistance, it is assumed to have the other. (The effects have similar ends despite having been brought about by different means.)

  

All spells that dispel magic have equal effect against powers of the same level using the same mechanics, and vice versa.

  

The spell detect magic detects powers, their number, and their strength and location within 3 rounds (though a Spellcraft check is necessary to identify the discipline of the psionic aura), while detect psionics detects spells, their number, and their strength and location within 3 rounds (though a Spellcraft check is necessary to identify the school of magic).

  

Dead magic areas are also dead psionics areas.

  

Unless specifically mentioned in a power’s description, a power cannot be counterspelled when it is being manifested, nor can powers be used to counterspell a spell as it is being cast. Unless specifically stated otherwise, feats such as metamagic feats that specifically affect spells do not affect powers, and feats such as metapsionic feats that specifically affect powers do not affect spells.

  

Powers or psionic effects usually work as described no matter how many other powers, psionic effects, spells, or magical effects happen to be operating in the same area or on the same recipient. Except in special cases, a power does not affect the way another power or spell operates. Whenever a power has a specific effect on other powers or spells, the power description explains the effect (and vice versa for spells that affect powers). Several other general rules apply when powers, spells, magical effects, or psionic effects operate in the same place. Powers that provide bonuses or penalties on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and other attributes usually do not stack with themselves. More generally, two bonuses of the same type don’t stack even if they come from different powers, or one from a power and one from a spell. You use whichever bonus gives you the better result.

  

Different Bonus Types: The bonuses or penalties from two different powers, or a power and a spell, stack if the effects are of different types. A bonus that isn’t named (just a “+2 bonus” rather than a “+2 insight bonus”) stacks with any bonus.

  

Same Effect More than Once in Different Strengths: In cases when two or more similar or identical effects are operating in the same area or on the same target, but at different strengths, only the best one applies. If one power or spell is dispelled or its duration runs out, the other power or spell remains in effect (assuming its duration has not yet expired).

  

Same Effect with Differing Results: The same power or spell can sometimes produce varying effects if applied to the same recipient more than once. The last effect in a series trumps the others. None of the previous spells or powers are actually removed or dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell or power in the series lasts.

  

One Effect Makes Another Irrelevant: Sometimes, a power can render another power irrelevant.

  

Multiple Mental Control Effects: Sometimes psionic or magical effects that establish mental control render one another irrelevant. Mental controls that don’t remove the recipient’s ability to act usually do not interfere with one another, though one may modify another. If a creature is under the control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If the controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers must make opposed Charisma checks to determine which one the creature obeys.

  

Powers and spells with opposite effects apply normally, with all bonuses, penalties, or changes accruing in the order that they apply. Some powers and spells negate or counter each other. This is a special effect that is noted in a power’s or spell’s description.

  

Instantaneous Effects: Two or more magical or psionic effects with instantaneous durations work cumulatively when they affect the same object, place, or creature.

  

Transparency between Magic Schools and Disciplines: For the purposes of psionic-magic transparency, powers in a given discipline have an associated school of magic. Creatures immune to that discipline, are also immune to that school of magic, and vice versa. Please use the table below to determine transparency between schools and disciplines

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Magic School|Psionic Discipline|
|Abjuration|–|
|Conjuration|Metacreativity|
|Divination|Clairsentience|
|Enchantment|Enchantment|
|Evocation|Psychokinesis|
|Illusion|–|
|Necromancy|Athanatism|
|Transmutation|Psychometabolism|
|Universal|–|
|Conjuration (teleportation)|Psychoportation|

  
  

Psionic-Magic Transparency and Psionic Options in Spheres of Power

While psionic feats and equipment have a distinct set of mechanics attached to them, most of these mechanics can be converted with relative ease to characters and games that utilize Spheres of Power. Feats, equipment, and other abilities which use psionics-specific subsystems should be converted based on the following parameters. Characters may only combine both Spheres of Power and Psionics if they have chosen both of those options from the allowed sources list.

  

Psionic Feats: Any character that possesses a casting tradition is capable of selecting psionic feats. The character uses their magic skill bonus as their manifester level and total levels in a psionic class for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.

  

Feats which would grant a character power points may instead grant them an equal number of spell points. If a class would grant the ability to select psionic feats as bonus feats, a character can also select an extra magic talent, champion feats, or any feat which has casting as a prerequisite (Item Creation feats, Metamagic Feats, Sphere Focus, Circle Casting, etc.).

  

Power Points: For any purpose save for manifesting powers, a character may spend spell points in place of power points. A spell point is worth a number of power points equal to 1 + the caster's MSB/4 (rounded down). (for example, a level 5 elan dread could spend a spell point to reduce damage taken by 4 with their resilience racial trait, spend 2 spell points to increase the damage from their horrible strike terror by 2d6, or spend a single spell point to empower their deep crystal weapon to deal additional damage, as 1 spell point is worth 2 power points. If the dread were level 13, these values would change to 8 and 4d6 respectively, as 1 spell point would be worth 4 power points). When converting spell points into power points, you cannot spend a number of effective power points greater than your caster level.

  

Psionic Focus: If a character possesses the Mental Focus drawback, they may expend mental focus as if it were psionic focus for any purpose. For the purpose of meeting prerequisites, the Fast Focus feat counts as the Psionic Meditation feat. Any feat or ability that would affect psionic focus (such as the Deep Focus feat) instead affects mental focus. Alternatively, a character may spend a spell point in place of psionic focus to achieve an effect which would require it.

  

Psionic Prestige Classes: A character with spherecasting abilities counts as having a pool of power points for the purpose of meeting prerequisites, and can use their caster level in place of a manifester level for the purpose of meeting prerequisites. They are considered capable of manifesting powers with a level equal to half their caster level (rounded down) and may substitute magic talents for similar psionic powers.

  

At every level that a psionic prestige class would grant an increase to powers known and manifester level, a character can instead choose to increase their caster level by 1 and learn a magic talent.

  

Every level in a prestige class which could grant power points, increased manifester level, or powers known can increase a character's spell pool by 1 spell point for every level they possess.

  

Effects of these prestige classes which apply to power points instead apply to spell points, converting the amounts as normal (see the Power Points rules above). Effects that apply to psionic powers may instead apply to talents.

  

## Mounted Interactions

You may ride any creature as long as it is your size or larger and has sufficient carrying capacity to lift you. You take the -5 penalty on Ride checks for riding an ill-suited mount if your mount is a non-avian biped, or is the same size as you. The Undersized Mount feat negates this penalty for mounts of the same size as you, unless they are also a non-avian biped.

  

When riding a creature, you share that creature’s space for all purposes (as stated in the Mounted Combat rules), including for determining the area of spell effects centered on you.

  

Fighting Blind

If you attack blindly into a square and the square contains more than one creature, the target of the attack is determined randomly with equal probability for all creatures in the square.

## Size Changes and Damage Dice Progression

When the damage dealt by a creature’s weapons or natural attacks changes due to a change in its size (or the size of its weapon), use the following rules to determine the new damage.

  

• If the size increases by one step, look up the original damage on the chart and increase the damage by two steps. If the initial size is Small or lower (or is treated as Small or lower) or the initial damage is 1d6 or less, instead increase the damage by one step.

• If the size decreases by one step, look up the original damage on the chart and decrease the damage by two steps. If the initial size is Medium or lower (or is treated as Medium or lower) or the initial damage is 1d8 or less, instead decrease the damage by one step.

• If the exact number of original dice is not found on this chart, apply the following before adjusting the damage dice. If the damage is a number of d6, find the next lowest number of d6 on the chart and use that number of d8 as the original damage value (for example, 10d6 would instead be treated as 8d8). If the damage is a number of d8, find the next highest number of d8 on the chart and use that number of d6 as the original damage value (for example, 5d8 would instead be treated as 6d6). Once you have the new damage value, adjust by the number of steps noted above.

• If the die type is not referenced on this chart, apply the following rules before adjusting the damage dice. 2d4 counts as 1d8 on the chart, 3d4 counts as 2d6 on the chart, and so on for higher numbers of d4. 1d12 counts as 2d6 on the chart, and so on for higher numbers of d12.

• Finally, 2d10 increases to 4d8 and decreases to 2d8, regardless of the initial size, and so on for higher numbers of d10.

# House Rules

Carrying capacity for all characters is treated as though they have a Strength score 4 points higher than their actual Strength score.

  

Gold when minted into coins is weightless as long as you don't think about it. If you do think about it, it immediately gains weight again; unless this is part of some scheme, in which case it functions in whichever way is least convenient for you.

  

Sneak attack deals damage on all qualifying attacks you make in a round, including simultaneous attacks from a spell. As long as every attack requires a separate attack roll and still separately qualifies for sneak attack, you may apply the sneak attack damage to that attack.

  

Potion Drinking: Drawing and drinking a potion is a single standard action, if it’s in an accessible place (i.e. not in a bag). Bandoliers and belt pouches are acceptable.

  

Precision Damage and Concealment: Precision damage can be used against targets with concealment, but not total concealment.

  

If a character possesses or obtains more than two limbs which are capable of making attacks, they may never possess more than one attack from each additional limb attacking beyond the first two. This does not prevent the character from using all of their attacks granted from the character’s base attack bonus with their original limb or limbs or from other abilities which may grant additional attacks, such as flurry of blows; but only limits attacks gained by additional limbs beyond the first two.

  

Drugs count as poisons for all abilities and effects that are affected by poisons, except that you cannot accidentally dose yourself with a drug. A character who is resistant or immune to poisons may choose to allow a drug to affect them as though they do not have their resistance or immunity; if they do so, they gain both the positive and negative effects of the drug as though they were not immune, but do not have to save against addiction.

## Subordinate Creatures (Cohorts, Familiars, Animal Companions, etc.)

Players may have multiple subordinate creatures such as cohorts, followers, eidolons, phantoms, drakes, animated undead, creatures conjured with planar binding, planar ally, or entice fey, conjuration sphere companions, veil companions, constellation champions, vestigial pact bonds, simulacrum,  creatures summoned with conjuration (summoning) spells or other such creatures. Players running multiple subordinates are expected to manage them all in a timely fashion. However, GMs have the right to limit how many subordinate creatures a player brings into combat at any one time. This limit will typically not exceed more than 2-3 creatures or sources for creatures at a time. For example, a player may be allowed to bring two animal companions; an animal companion and a familiar; an animal companion and an eidolon; or cast multiple summon spells without it being cause for concern, although this limit may change in certain adventures or with certain GMs. GMs maintain the final say on what the limit is in the games that they are running

  

Your followers and minions cannot themselves also have combat capable minions. For example, an animal companion cannot take the Familiar Bond feat to obtain a familiar, and a cohort gained from leadership cannot themselves gain an animal companion or a cohort. If a subordinate gains a minion, only one of the subordinate or the minion may interact with you in combat within the same encounter.

  

Characters with Animal Companions, Mounts, or other non-sentient companions automatically succeed Handle Animal checks to use Tricks the companion has been taught.

  

The Plant creature options available to the Treesinger druid are available to all characters who may have a plant companion.

  

Per the rules detailed in Animal Archive, page 18, animal companions and familiars may take the following feats. Familiars may choose to take these feats by switching them out for their default feats (as listed in the familiar’s statistics. Critical Conduit, Extra Item Slot, Familiar Focus, Jumper, Lithe Attacker,  Master of your Kind, Narrow Frame, Spell Sponge, Stable Gallop, Sure Footed, Valiant Steed.

  

Animal Companions and Familiars  have access to the following magical item slots, based on on their body layout. Creature body types marked with an asterisk (*) are able to grasp and carry one object at a time in their paws, claws, or hands, including weapons, rods, wands, and staves, though they may not be able to use such items effectively (GM’s discretion) and take penalties for nonproficiency as usual

Avian* (armor, belt, eyes, headband, neck, ring, saddle, wrist)

Biped* [claws/paws] (Armor, belt, chest, eyes, headband, neck, ring, shoulders, wrist)

Biped* [hands] (all item slots)

Piscine (Belt, chest (saddle), eyes)

Quadruped [claws] (Armor, belt, chest (saddle), eyes, headband, neck, shoulders, wrist)

Quadruped/Hexapod [feet] (Armor, belt, chest (saddle), eyes, headband, neck, shoulders, wrist)

Quadruped [hooves] (Armor, belt, chest (saddle), eyes, feet (horseshoes), head, headband, neck, shoulders, wrist)

Quadruped [squat-body] (armor, chest (saddle), eyes, headband, neck, shoulders, wrist)

Saurian (armor, belt, chest (saddle), eyes, head, headband, neck)

Serpentine (belt, eyes, headband)

Unusual (belt, eyes, headband)

Verminous (belt, eyes)

  

Cohorts may take heroic classes. Followers may only take NPC classes. They may retrain into heroic classes. However, they must spend the days of downtime retraining and gold to do this. This wealth provided by the player they follow in order to do this. 

  

You can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than yourself.

  

Followers may only be 5 or more levels lower than yourself, and may never be a higher level than 6.

  

Cohorts and followers use the following array for stats: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. They use the same build rules as player characters, except as follows: 

- Cohorts and followers are not permitted to be gestalt characters
    
- Cohorts and followers may not take a major drawback for an extra feat
    
- Cohorts and followers may not use custom origins or custom races
    
- Cohorts and followers may not use Variant Multiclass
    
- Cohorts and followers may not use Automatic Bonus Progression
    
- Cohorts and followers may not use Oaths
    
- Cohorts and followers may not spend drawbacks for additional traits or feats
    
- Cohorts and followers do not gain an additional bonus origin talent progression
    
- Cohorts and followers may not sacrifice their class skills for a Trade Tradition.
    
- Cohorts and followers may not possess other cohorts or followers.
    
- Cohorts followers, animal companions, and other companions of this sort do not independently gain wealth when they level up, their equipment is drawn from the wealth of the master to which they pledge their service.
    

  

When determining Follower counts and Cohort levels for leadership scores over 25, use the chart contained within [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSXR43EILkm1wh28wFjcDA25pqO6OT3dJlR8mpzLJVK9JIgbWhAO2lhQ9ecCv0CL3AypFakUQxnaaIG/pub). This does not allow you to have a cohort or followers who are a higher level than the restrictions listed above. (Special Thanks to natedawg22 for compiling this).

## Weapons

All classes that gain proficiency with all martial weapons now gain proficiency with one additional exotic weapon of their choice. If you gain proficiency with all martial weapons from multiple sources, you may select a proficiency with a different exotic weapon for each source that granted you said martial weapon proficiency.

  

Characters which gain Weapon Proficiency with all Martial Weapons may choose to instead gain proficiency with all [Eastern Weapons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/eastern-weapons/) or with all weapons from a weapon group of their choice. If they gain proficiency with martial weapons from an additional source, they may choose to gain proficiency with an additional weapon group at that time.

  

Weapon Focus now grants proficiency to all weapons in the selected Weapon Group, in addition to its previous benefits.

  

Characters with Arcane Pool, Divine Bond, Bane, and similar class features can enhance a weapon beyond the standard modified limit of +10, however they may still only have +5 enhancement bonus with the additional bonuses being weapon modifications.

  

Characters with Arcane Pool, Divine Bond, Bane, and similar class features can enhance both ends of a double weapon if desired. (Double Bane and similar abilities are not required!)

  

Tower Shields now have an armor check penalty of -4 and an arcane spell failure chance of 25% instead of -10 and 50%, respectively.

  

Characters may choose to deal a Coup de Grace with a non-lethal or Merciful weapon. If the target fails the Fortitude save against this Coup de Grace, they are knocked unconscious for a number of hours equal to 1/5 the damage dealt (minimum one hour).

  

Add the following text to the Trip Special Weapon Feature:

“When you use a trip weapon, you get a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver Checks on trip attempts.”

  

Any creature with claws can make their unarmed strikes deal slashing damage.

  

Reach weapons may attack adjacent large or larger creatures if they threaten one of their other spaces at the cost of taking a soft cover penalty on the attack

### Weapon Groups

All feats, class features, and abilities that apply to a single weapon now apply to all weapons in that weapon group. If a weapon is in multiple weapon groups, choose a weapon group at the time you gain the ability for it to apply to. Default weapons groups in use are listed below. Weapons may be added to other weapon groups if there is reasonable justification.

## Magic

There exists no means in the game by which magic can be used to simply fabricate gold into existence. Although there are things in the rules that may suggest it, none of these will work within the bounds of this server and space. Magic may be used to circumvent costs, such as forgoing material components on spells like raise dead, but it cannot be used to create gold for free expenditure. 

  

Regardless of the type of undead or spells you use to create them, you can never create a single undead with HD greater than four times your caster level, or your caster level +12, whichever is lower. Effective HD increases for the purposes of animation, such as the Fast Zombie template do not count towards an undead's HD for this purpose.

  

Characters with spellbooks, formula books, and similar written spell preparation methods are able to study and learn any spell or formula from another book that is equivalent to a spell the book contains. If you know or can prepare a spell via another class or spell-like ability, you may treat that spell as having been understood or deciphered for the purposes of scribing that spell into your spellbook or formula book. Characters may still only learn spells or formulae that are on their respective class list in this fashion.

  

Alchemist’s and investigator’s extracts count as being on their spell list for the purpose of spell trigger and spell completion items.

  

Both Alchemists and Investigators count as spellcasters capable of casting spells equal to the extract levels they can create for the purpose of qualifying for and progressing prestige classes and feats, although they do not count as arcane or divine spellcasters for the purpose of prerequisites. Example, an alchemist of at least 7th level would be able to qualify for Hellknight Signifier, and an investigator of at least 4th level would be able to qualify for Pathfinder Savant. The usefulness of these choices being irrelevant to the example.

  

Any effect, class feature, or ability that requires choosing arcane or divine spellcasting also allows the choice of psychic casting unless it simply would not function with psychic casting.

  

Witch patron spells, oracle mystery spells, and sorcerer bloodline spells part of spellcasting and progress with prestige classes

  

Meditative spells from the Divine Anthology sourcebook had rather confusing wording in their rules which ambiguously required a spellcaster to use one or two spell slots per spell, and prevented many arcane casters with access to SLAs from using the spells. Use the following wording as a replacement for the rules for spells with the Meditative Descriptor.

Meditative spells are not cast like other spells—they are cast during the period of the day when a spellcaster prepares her spells. A meditative spell is both prepared and cast during your 1-hour spell preparation ritual, and at the end of that time, the meditative spell of your choosing is treated as having been cast. This leaves that spell slot used for the remainder of the day. You can have only one meditative spell in effect on you at any one time. All meditative spells have a range of personal and a target of you. They can't be brewed into potions or part of similar one-use items like elixirs, even if other options would allow it. A meditative spell can be placed on a scroll or in a wand or stave, but the act of casting the spell must always be incorporated into the user's spell-preparation time; it also takes 1 hour for a character who succeeds at an appropriate Use Magic Device check to operate such an item. Though meditative spells may appear on accessible spell lists, a Spontaneous spellcaster may never add a meditative spell to their list of spells known. Characters who do not have access to prepared spellcasting cannot benefit from the effects of a meditative spell, even if accessing such magic via Use Magic Device and a magic item, since part of the process of casting and maintaining the effects of a meditative spell involves tying the act of weaving the magic into the very process of meditation and study that a prepared spellcaster (such as a cleric or wizard) undergoes at the start of every day.

## Spells

All Illusion spells can, in addition to their other abilities, project the aura of another school of magic, but not a specific spell. Identifying that the aura is illusion, requires a spellcraft check equal to DC 15 + caster level of the spell. If this check is successful, the spell can then identified using the normal DC for identifying a spell.

  

Cure Minor Wounds is introduced as a new cantrip/orison. It is identical to Cure Light wounds, except it heals exactly 1 hitpoint with each cast and has a casting time of 1 full-round action. This is added to the spell list of all classes capable of casting Cure Light Wounds. Inflict Minor Wounds is also added as a negative energy equivalent to this spell. This is added to the spell list of all classes capable of casting Inflict Light Wounds.

  

For the sake of all abilities, feats, and class features that modify Cure spells, Breath of Life is treated as a Cure spell.

  

For the sake of all abilities, feats, and class features that modify Inflict spells, Slay Living is treated as an Inflict spell.

  

When delivering touch spells, characters may use their Strength or Dexterity bonus for the attack roll.

  

Gravity Bow now works on all ranged weapons.

  

Spells which have for example ‘sorcerer uses charisma’ always use the main spellcasting modifier of the class from which you cast the spell

## Flexible Chakra Binds

This server uses the flexible chakra binds optional rules. Every class that grants specific chakra binds through a class feature instead grants flexible chakra binds that may be changed each time such a character prepares their veils for the day. When determining their effective levels for selecting these binds, a character adds the levels of all of their veilweaving classes together (to a maximum of their character level).

Whenever a character would gain the Chakra Bind (Hands), Chakra Bind (Feet) or Chakra Bind (Head) class feature, they instead gain the Low Chakra Bind class feature:

Low Chakra Bind: The character gains access to a low chakra bind. Each day when they shape their veils, they can choose whether they wish to bind veils to the Hands or Feet slot. At 5th level, they additionally can choose between the Head slot as well. For each time they gain this ability beyond the first, they gain the ability to choose one additional chakra slot.

Whenever a character would gain the Chakra Bind (Wrists), Chakra Bind (Shoulders) or Chakra Bind (Headband) class feature, they instead gain the Middle Chakra Bind class feature:

Middle Chakra Bind: The character gains access to a middle chakra bind. Each day when they shape their veils, they can choose whether they wish to bind veils to the Wrists, Shoulders or Headband slot. For each time they gain this ability beyond the first, they gain the ability to choose one additional chakra slot.

Whenever a character would gain the Chakra Bind (Neck) or Chakra Bind (Belt) class feature, they instead gain the High Chakra Bind class feature:

High Chakra Bind: The character gains access to a high chakra bind. Each day when they shape their veils, they can choose whether they wish to bind veils to the Neck or Belt slot. For each time they gain this ability beyond the first, they gain the ability to choose one additional chakra slot.

Whenever a character would gain the Chakra Bind (Chest) or Chakra Bind (Body) class feature, they instead gain the Pinnacle Chakra Bind class feature:

Pinnacle Chakra Bind: The character gains access to a pinnacle chakra bind. Each day when they shape their veils, they can choose whether they wish to bind veils to the Chest or Body slot. For each time they gain this ability beyond the first, they gain the ability to choose one additional chakra slot. 

## Standardized Essence Capacity

This server uses the Standardized Essence Capacity rules. A character’s improved essence capacity scales based on their total levels in veilweaving classes, rather than through the Improved Essence Capacity class feature. Characters do not gain the Improved Essence Capacity class feature when using this ruleset. Instead, characters add all of their class levels in veilweaving classes together (maximum of their character level) and gain a bonus to their essence capacity as per below:

- Total Level 3+: +1 increase to essence capacity.
    
- Total Level 9+: +2 increase to essence capacity.
    
- Total Level 15+: +3 increase to essence capacity.
    

These increases to essence capacity are in addition to those gained through total Hit Dice, and do not stack with abilities that function similarly to the improved essence capacity class feature. Classes that gain improved essence capacity as a class feature count as veilweaving classes for this optional rule, even if they cannot shape veils (such as the zodiac). 

## Feats

Noble Scion: Arts now additionally grants its bonus to Artistry and art-related Craft skills like Craft (painting) and Craft (sculpture)

  

Spontaneous Metamagic: Classes which can apply metamagic to spells that are cast spontaneously (Ex: Sorcerers, Bards, Clerics casting Cure spells, Druids casting Summon Nature’s Ally, etc) no longer must increase the casting time of the spell when doing so.

  

Path of War, Spheres of Might, and Attack Actions

Both the rulesets for Path of War and Spheres of Might offer a character a lot of options to add modifications and riders to attacks or attack actions. For the sake of this server, these interact in the following way:

- A Path of War strike maneuver is considered a special attack action for the purposes of these interactions, and Spheres talents which function only with attack actions may not be used in combination with a strike.
    

## Combat Maneuvers and Special Attack Actions

When making a combat maneuver without the relevant feat, you only provoke an attack of opportunity if you fail on your CMB check.

  

Some combat maneuvers and special attack actions have had the actions they use adjusted to make more viable options for most characters. The new actions they use are summarized below. There are options available in Spheres of Might that will allow these Combat Maneuvers to function with different actions as well; those Talents still function normally and are not overwritten by these changes.

  

Bull Rush:  As a Standard Action; or In place of a melee attack as part of a charge; or in place of a melee attack if you possess Powerful Maneuvers

  

Called Shot: As a Full-Round Action; or as a Standard Action if you possess Greater Called Shot

  

Dirty Trick: As a Move action; or as a Swift Action if you possess Deft Maneuvers; or In place of a melee attack if you possess Greater Deft Maneuvers or Greater Dirty Trick

  

Disarm: As a Standard Action; or In place of a melee attack; or as a Swift action if you possess Deft Maneuvers

  

Drag: As a standard action; or as a Move action if you possess Powerful Maneuvers

  

Feint: As a Move action; or as a Swift Action if you possess Deft Maneuvers; or In place of a melee attack if you possess Greater Deft Maneuvers or Greater Feint

  

Grapple: As a Standard Action; or as a Move Action if you possess the Rapid Grapple feat.

  

Overrun: As a Standard Action; or in place of a melee attack as part of a charge in place of any melee attack if you possess Greater Powerful Maneuvers or Greater Overrun

  

Reposition: As a standard action; or as a Move Action if you possess Deft Maneuvers

  

Steal: As a standard action; or as a Move Action if you possess Deft Maneuvers

  

Sunder: As a Standard Action; or; In place of a melee attack; or as a Move Action if you possess Powerful Maneuvers

  

Trip: As a Standard Action; or In place of a melee attack; or as a Move Action if you possess Powerful Maneuvers

## Favored Classes

There are no Favored Classes. Every time you gain a level, you may select 1 bonus HP, 1 bonus Skill Point, or the Favored Class Bonus of a class you took a level in that level. Additionally, you may take the favored class bonus of any race, not just the race of your character. 

  

The below additional choices are added to the list of available favored class bonus options you may select each level

- +1/6 feat (has no effect until selected 6 times)
    
- +1/6 potent origin talent (has no effect until selected 6 times)
    
- +1 foot to base speed (has no effect until selected 5 times)
    
- +1/8 of a bonus to an attribute of your choice
    
- Reduce the weapon nonproficiency penalty with a single weapon by 1. When the penalty reaches 0, you gain proficiency with that weapon.
    
- Reduce the armor check penalty for nonproficiency by 1 for one of the following categories: light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, bucklers, light and heavy shields, or tower shields. When you select a single category to benefit from this bonus four times, you gain proficiency with that category. You cannot select a category of shield or armors if you are not already proficient with all lighter categories.
    

## Spell Resistance

Unconscious or dead creatures offer up no spell resistance. Creatures can willingly lower their spell resistance until the beginning of their next turn as a swift action. Creatures can alternately spend a full-round action to lower their spell resistance, in which case their spell resistance will remain down until they spend a full-round action to activate it again. A creature must have an Intelligence score of at least 5 in order to intentionally lower its spell resistance.

  

Spell resistance is effective against psionic powers, using the same mechanics. Likewise, power resistance is effective against spells, using the same mechanics as spell resistance. If a creature has one kind of resistance, it is assumed to have the other. (The effects have similar ends despite having been brought about by different means.)

  

Similarly, effects that would dispel or counterspell a psionic power can be used to dispel or counterspell a spell using the same mechanics, and vice versa.

## Taking A Breather

Once per encounter, any character can take a full round action to rest, regroup, and focus his or her thoughts. Taking a breather allows you to do one of the following: 

  

Heal lost hit points to an amount up to your character level + the greater of your Constitution bonus or your skill ranks in the Heal skill. (not your total bonus with the Heal skill)

Gain a bonus equal to +1, plus an additional +1 per 4 levels, to one d20 roll or damage roll made during the next round; or

Gain a +1 bonus to the save DC of one spell cast the next round.

  

Because taking a breather is an action, conditions that prohibit actions—such as being stunned or held—prevent you from taking a breather. Because you can only take a breather once per encounter, you cannot stand around between fights taking breathers until you are fully healed; rather, this gives all characters a chance to heal some damage during an adventure without the need for magic.

## Immediate Actions

Immediate actions no longer borrow against the swift actions of the next round. They are instead their own type of action. Each character has both one swift action and one immediate action each round.

## Dazzled Condition

A -1 to attacks and Perception rolls is so minor as to be hardly worth tracking. Instead, the dazzled condition now applies partial concealment (20% miss chance) to everything the afflicted creature sees. In addition, it applies a -4 penalty to Perception checks.

## Immunity to Mind-Affecting Effects

Constructs, Plants, Undead, Inevitables, Kami, Vermin and other creatures with an intelligence score are no longer granted immunity to mind-affecting effects by their respective types or subtypes. Instead, they receive a bonus on all saves made to resist mind-affecting effects equal to 4 + 1/2 their HD (round down). Abilities that allow a character to ignore immunity to mind-affecting effects, either in general or for that respective type or subtype, ignore this bonus. Creatures of these types and subtypes that have no Intelligence score receive the following ability:

- Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). If the creature gains an Intelligence score, it loses this immunity.
    

## Stealth

Add the following text to the section on breaking Stealth:

When you start your turn using Stealth, you can leave cover or concealment and remain unobserved as long as you succeed at a Stealth check and end your turn in cover or concealment. Your Stealth immediately ends after you make an attack roll, whether or not the attack is successful. If you attack after successfully using Stealth, your target is flat-footed against your attack.

## Magic Items

Bracers of Archery now apply to all attacks with ranged weapons.

  

The Returning magic weapon special ability allows for the weapon to immediately return to the wielder’s hand after being thrown, instead of at the beginning of the wielder's next turn

  

Composite Crossbows can be purchased with an Adaptive enchantment.

  

The below enchantment is added as an option to be added to crossbows.

  

Winding 

Aura faint transmutation CL 3rd

Slot weapon quality; Price +12,000 gp; Weight —

This enchantment can only be applied to crossbows. This reduces the action required to reload all crossbows requiring full-round actions to move actions, and reduces the action required to reload all crossbows requiring move actions to free actions. Crossbow with this enchantment can be reloaded without provoking attacks of opportunity

Construction

Requirements Craft Magic Arms and Armor, warp wood; Price +1000 gp

  

Ioun Stone Resonant Powers use the static assignment rule for resonant powers and normal ioun stones always have a resonant power. Ioun stones do not need to be socketed into a Wayfinder in order to gain their resonant powers.

## Aid Another

Unless a higher limit is explicitly stated within the ability, no more than four creatures may aid in any one action. This applies whether or not that creature is using aid another or any other ability that allows cooperatively granting a bonus to aid in a specific roll, such as the coven hex, cooperative crafting, or teamwork feats

  

For every 10 by which you beat your aid another check, you grant an additional +1 to the aided roll. This stacks with other increases to aid another.

## “Sealed Container” Combat

 Creatures cannot participate in combat while inside of a sealed/protected container (open the container, take action, close the container-type stuff). It is either a combatant on the board, or can be passively “in the background” supplying prearranged bonuses, passive abilities, acting as a witch’s spellbook, etc. The exception to this is creatures and abilities that allow a creature to fully ignore line of sight and/or line of effect.

## Races

Outsiders with the native subtype such as Tieflings and Aasimar count as Humanoids and Outsiders for the purpose of all abilities and effects.

## Specific Class Changes

Classes, prestige classes and feats no longer require the worship of specific deities as part of their prerequisites. This may require the adjustment of the flavor for that specific character

  

All abilities granted by Domains, Bloodlines, Schools, etc that deal minimal nonscaling damage such as 1d6+1 or 1d6+class level now deal 1d4 for every 2 class levels you possess. This damage increases to 1d6 per two class levels if the ability requires melee range.

For example, if you choose Performance (Oratory), you can take any points you had in Diplomacy and Sense Motive and put them in other skills.
    

  

Bloodrager

- Clerics gain proficiency with their deity’s favored weapon
    

  

Drake Companions

- Drake companions have undergone a full rework, which affects all archetypes that grant them. The details are listed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTYfWXIG8q4UrBM2KF1DihF_7a20mBK-aUc7MkVPI_f3ICijG-btPljeOyFNkgRpoeBWbFidgh0PXmz/pub).
    

  

Druid

- Druid may now be any neutral or lawful alignment
    
- The Ashvawg Tamer archetype gains the Improved Companion feat, as listed in our EITR rules, in place of their Variant Companion and Exotic Companion class features.
    

  

Familiars

- Any familiar can grant any of the standard familiar bonuses. As an example, a Cat can grant a +2 bonus to fort saves, or a Crab could grant a +4 bonus to initiative. This option has been granted to allow more flavorful choices for familiar instead of having all players choosing the same familiar options for optimization purposes.
    
- Improved Familiars do not lose the ability to Speak With Creatures of their Kind, and thus can still take Familiar Archetypes
    
- All improved familiars can now be taken by someone who is one step away from their listed alignment on one or both alignment axes. No improved familiar options are restricted to use by a single alignment, even if otherwise specified in the familiars text. For example, a Quasit could be taken by someone who is True Neutral, as they are one step away from chaotic, and one step away from evil.

- Ranged Study: You can just use studied combat with a ranged weapon by default to a distance of 30 feet. You can take an investigator talent to increase it to 60 feet.
    
- The prerequisite level to take any Studied Combat Investigator Talent is reduced to 1/2 (rounded down)
    
- Investigators now gain the Quick Study talent automatically at 7th level.

Spiritualist

- Phantoms:
    

- Skills: The proper amount of skill ranks the phantom gets per HD is 6 + INT, not 2 + INT. The amount shown in the table matches this (6 base, with 2 ranks per level already invested in the phantom’s emotion skills, and –2 ranks per level due to having an INT of 7, leaving it with the value shown on the table to assign).
    
- Incorporeal Movement: A phantom at 1st level does not yet have incorporeal flight, but by RAW incorporeal creatures always move by flight, so it can’t actually move? Anyway, we’re gonna rule that phantoms below 9th level get a sort of incorporeal “glide”. They can hover above surfaces as if flying, but if not a few inches above a surface will fall slowly to the ground as a glide effect.
    

  

Summoner

- If a Mirrored Soul summoner also takes levels in Striker, with the voidrusher archetype, this functions as follows. They may still summon this companion using the rules for mirrored soul. While it is summoned, the summoner and their companion follow the mirrored soul's soul eidolon abilities regarding what actions they may take and temporarily lose the avatar's presence and enshroud abilities, and may not use any ability that relies on being enshrouded. Similarly, they may not grant their avatar any actions, such as with umbral stalk, and the avatar must use its own actions, following the rules laid out in mirrored soul. The avatar also temporarily loses the unbodied features while summoned.

- The Coven Hex now uses the following wording: “The witch counts as a hag for the purpose of joining a hag's coven. The coven must contain at least one hag.

This bonus cannot be increased by any means. This bonus applies to the witch's spells and all of her hexes.”
