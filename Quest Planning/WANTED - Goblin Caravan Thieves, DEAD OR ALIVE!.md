The Aspis Consortium has long dealt with attacks on their caravans by hiring mercenaries and guards for their goods, and accounting for some amount of successful highway robbery besides. Recently, however, a pack of particularly pesky goblins, the self-proclaimed “Tooth-n-Nail Tribe”, managed to get away with a significant sum of wealth in gemstones, books, and other trade goods of an uncommon enough variety that the Aspis Consortium has summoned a party of adventurers to seek their den in the southern foothills of the Aspodell Mountain and either slay or capture their leader, an oddly mutated goblin-ogre known as “Tark-Tark the Sniffer”

Quest w/ some exploration elements + dungeon run for adventurers level 2-6

Designing 3 encounters for the party to potentially encounter prior to discovering the goblin camp. Takes 3 days of IC travel to the cavern, assuming no faster mode of transportation available. Roll d% at the beginning of each day (75% chance for no encounter), allow for some in-character travel chatter, then move on to next day.

## Encounter 1: The Faerie Springs

In the foothills of the Aspodell mountains are rumors of a fog-shrouded spring which functions as a portal to the First World under the right conditions. Though the conditions today are not right, the spring is still full of the revitalizing natural energies of the first world. Water drawn from the spring is treated as Holy Water, and taking a bath in the spring grants a Sacred bonus to AC and Saving Throws equal to 1/2 of the subject’s level for the next 1d4 days. Construct and undead creatures do not gain any benefit from the springs. A DC 24 Knowledge (Planes) check reveals this information.

## Encounter 2: A Lost Child?

Upon the night that this encounter is rolled, as the party settles in to rest, they hear the far-away sound of a child weeping.

If the party chooses to investigate, they find a small, dripping wet goblin child adjacent to a nearby river. The child will accept any aid that they offer, and will introduce herself as “Sasche” (pronounced similarly to “Sasha”) but is reluctant to speak of their origin, home, or family. If the party mentions that they are sent there to kill the leader of the Tooth-n-Nail Tribe, the goblinette will speak up
