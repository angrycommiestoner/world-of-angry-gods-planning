The Minaret is an ancient tower thought to be connected in some way to the ancient human peoples of Gelt, as well as the long-buried Dwarven tribes of Mistholme. Some scholars believe that the Minaret was a trade outpost, a sort of inversion of the great Well of Many Worlds known to dwell far below Mistholme, which those Dwarves used long ago to trade with the Ifrits of the Elemental Plane of Fire, theorizing that the reason for the Minaret’s disappearance and reappearance in the choking mists of the Fog Peaks is due to the runaway planar energies of that Well, which the Dwarves of Mistholme long ago collapsed their tunnels to seal off. Others believe that the tower’s strange “teleportation” is simply a tall-tale told by travelers who lost their bearings between sighting the great spire. Whatever the truth of the matter, the ruins of Mistholme are an unexplored ruin the likes of which most Pathfinders can only dream of in this modern era.
