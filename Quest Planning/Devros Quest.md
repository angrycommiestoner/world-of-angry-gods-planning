# Quest Overview
Devros was born as a result of the meddling of an Astradaemon in the affairs of a broken cult of Aroden in the wake of the death of the God of the Azlanti.

Now, rumors of dark heresies committed by Father Traric reek of similar Daemonic meddling. Now the young man, unknowing host to a sliver of the abhorrent daemonic being known as The Bound Prince, seeks a way to avert the tragedy he has forseen. The Dawnflower whispers in his dreams, prompting him to take up her light to sear away the darkness that occupies her temple.

Dungeon Run for PCs level 5-8

Planning 5 fights, 3 small traps/non-combat encounters, 1 big trap/non-combat encounter, 1 boss fight.
# Room 1: Temple Vestebule
Here the party will be welcomed warmly by a Priestess of Sarenrae. A DC 50 Sense Motive or Spellcraft check reveals that this Priestess' mind is asleep and being actively controlled at a distance by something else. She will recognize Devros ("from Father Traric's description" if asked), approach the party, and offer to escort them to a private room where the Father would be "happy to meet them."
# Encounter 1: Secret Sanctuary

The hidden room the party is escorted to is well hidden, and the Priestess takes deliberate pains not to reveal the mechanism by which the door is opened to the party. A DC 28 Perception roll is required to spot her secretly operate the mechanism in the floor.

If the party follows the Priestess without resistance, she will lock them in the room, and release a poisonous gas into the room via a hidden mechanism. The party receives 1 round to make a DC 30 Perception check followed by a DC 35 Disable Device or Knowledge (Engineering) check to discover and use a similar floor mechanism inside the room to unlock and open the door before they must begin making saves against this poison (DC 28 Fortitude, on failure take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage for 1d4 rounds. Being reduced to 1 Wisdom or less causes the victim to fall unconscious until the poison passes from their system.)

# Encounter 2: The Long Hall
After freeing themselves from the hidden room, the party is confronted by an obviously addled Paladin of Sarenrae, half-leading, half-led by 3 large bloodhounds. At the sight of the party, the Paladin and all 3 beasts attack without hesitation. DC 30 Knowledge (Planes) check reveals the dogs for what they are, Abyss Hounds, more destructive and hungry Daemonic counterparts to Hellhounds.

### Description

An Abyssal Hound resembles a demented artist's vision of a greyhound, standing at between 4–5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing 120 pounds on average. It is said that Abyss Hounds hunger endlessly and, once they have sunk their teeth into prey, they will hold on relentlessly until they drag their prey down from sheer exhaustion.
