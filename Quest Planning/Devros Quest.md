# Quest Overview
Devros was born as a result of the meddling of an Astradaemon in the affairs of a broken cult of Aroden in the wake of the death of the God of the Azlanti.

Now, rumors of dark heresies committed by Father Traric reek of similar Daemonic meddling. Now the young man, unknowing host to a sliver of the abhorrent daemonic being known as The Bound Prince, seeks a way to avert the tragedy he has forseen. The Dawnflower whispers in his dreams, prompting him to take up her light to sear away the darkness that occupies her temple.

Dungeon Run for PCs level 7-11

Planning 7 fights, 5 small traps, 1 big trap, 1 boss fight.
# Room 1: Temple Vestebule
Here the party will be welcomed warmly by a Priestess of Sarenrae. A DC 50 Sense Motive or Spellcraft check reveals that this Priestess' mind is asleep and being actively controlled at a distance by something else. She will recognize Devros ("from Father Traric's description" if asked) and offer to escort them to a private room where the Father would be happy to meet them.
# Encounter 1: Secret Sanctuary

The hidden room the party is escorted to is well hidden, and the Priestess takes deliberate pains not to reveal the mechanism by which the door is opened to the party. A DC 38 Perception roll is required to spot her secretly operate the mechanism in the floor.

If the party follows the Priestess without resistance, she will lock them in the room, giving the Paladins of Sarenrae time to prebuff (+[Advanced](https://aonprd.com/MonsterTemplates.aspx?ItemName=Advanced) Template, +[Damage Reduction](https://aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Damage%20Reduction) 10/-). Give the party ~3 rounds worth of interaction to make a DC 38 Disable Device or Knowledge (Engineering) check to discover and use a similar floor mechanism inside the room, which will allow them to surprise the Paladins of Sarenrae instead.
