# Quest Overview
Devros was born as a result of the meddling of an Astradaemon in the affairs of a broken cult of Aroden in the wake of the death of the God of the Azlanti.

Now, rumors of dark heresies committed by Father Traric reek of similar Daemonic meddling. The young Devros, unknowing host to a sliver of the abhorrent daemonic being known as The Bound Prince, seeks a way to avert the tragedy he has forseen. The Dawnflower whispers in his dreams, prompting him to take up her light to sear away the darkness that occupies her temple.

Dungeon Run for PCs level 5-8

Planning 5 fights, 3 small traps/non-combat encounters, 1 big trap/non-combat encounter, 1 boss fight.
# Room 1: Temple Vestebule
Here the party will be welcomed warmly by a dark-haired Priestess of Sarenrae with bright green eyes. A DC 50 Sense Motive or Spellcraft check reveals that this Priestess' mind is asleep and being actively controlled at a distance by something else. She will recognize Devros ("from Father Traric's description" if asked), approach the party, and offer to escort them to a private room where the Father would be "happy to meet them."
# Room 2, Encounter 1: Secret Sanctuary

The hidden room the party is escorted to is well hidden, and the Priestess takes deliberate pains not to reveal the mechanism by which the door is opened to the party. A DC 25 Perception roll is required to spot her secretly operate the mechanism in the floor.

If the party follows the Priestess without resistance, she will lock them in the room, and release a poisonous gas into the room via a hidden mechanism. Once they realize they are trapped, the party may make a DC 40 Athletics check to try and force the door or a DC 25 Perception check followed by a DC 30 Disable Device or Knowledge (Engineering) check to discover and use the hidden mechanism inside the room to unlock and open the door. If the party unlocks or forces the door before disarming the gas trap, they only gain 1/2 the XP for the encounter.
## Statblock: Poisoned Gas Trap (CR 4, 1200 XP)
**Type** Mechanical; **Notice** Perception DC 22; **Remove** Disable Device DC 20; **Trigger** touch; **Reset** manual; **Bypass** hidden switch (DC 25 Perception to locate)
**Effect** Poison gas (Essence of Blue Whinnis); **Save** Fortitude DC 18 (Concentrated, +1 CR); **Special** This trap continues spewing poison until it is manually disabled. The primary activation method is a switch on the outside of the room the trap affects.

**Type** poison, inhaled; **Save** Fortitude DC 14
**Track** Constitution (Special, see text); **Frequency** 1/round for 2 rounds.
**Effect** Healthy—Weakened—Unconscious; No End State
# Room 3, Encounter 2: The Long Hall
After freeing themselves from the hidden room, the party is confronted by an obviously addled Paladin of Sarenrae, half-leading, half-led by 2 large bloodhounds. At the sight of the party, the Paladin and both beasts attack without hesitation. DC 15 Knowledge (Planes) check reveals the dogs for what they are, Abyss Hounds, more destructive and hungry Daemonic counterparts to Hellhounds. Upon finishing this fight, the party can continue further into the bowels of the church or return the way they came to the Vestibule in search of the Priestess.

## Statblock: Abyss Hound (CR 3)
_Some legends tell of a deal between Szuriel and Asmodeus that resulted in these mongrelized, Daemonic cousins to the infernal Hellhound. Some scholars, however, suggest perhaps, that their appearance is merely a rare case of covergent evolution across the astral sea. Whatever the case, these horrifying persistence hunters can be found across the multiverse wherever there are battlefields. They often possess warhounds and weave minor enchantments about their "owners" to disregard the odd changes such beasts undergo_

Having the nature of the creature pointed out is enough to allow a creature to roll a Will Save as if they had been attacked. This is a mind-affecting effect.

### Description

An Abyssal Hound resembles a demented artist's vision of a greyhound, standing at between 4–5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing 120 pounds on average. It is said that Abyss Hounds hunger endlessly and, once they have sunk their teeth into prey, they will hold on relentlessly until they drag their prey down from sheer exhaustion.
# Room 1b: Returning to the Vestibule, Exploring the Garden
Upon returning to the Vestibule, the party will find the murderous priestess missing, along with all of the other priests and parishioners visiting the Dawnmother's temple, whom the party would have certainly seen on their way in. The Vestibule lies abandoned. A DC 15 Perception check reveals that a stained glass mural against one wall contains a strangely arching "hidden" door integrated into one side of it, which leads to a small garden where patches of sunflowers, merigold, mint, and a few other tea herbs can be found. If the party takes their time to explore the garden, a DC 16 Survival check will allow a clever herbalist to gather a few of the more expensive herbs (Worth ~50 GP in Spell Components) from a slightly obscured box at the back of the garden.

# Room 4, Encounter 3: Angels in the Atrium
Continuing further down the hall into the Temple of Sarenrae eventually leads the party to a wide open atrium where oddly-shaped golden creatures zip from place to place, almost akin to birds. These creatures are Cassians, a type of angel renowned for their perfect memories, a fact which can be recalled with a successful DC 15 Knowledge (Planes) check. These Angels are not immediately hostile to the party, but will defend themselves if provoked. They show some deference to those that introduce themselves as worshippers of Sarenrae, and a DC 22 Diplomacy check will convince them to tell the party about the events of the last several weeks, including Father Traric’s sudden personality change and reclusion, as well as how orders from the church’s leader are coming now from the mouth of a stranger woman who wears the robes of Sarenrae, but who is constantly followed by an aura of death and horror. If asked to describe the woman, they will tell the party of an aged woman with long, braided silver-gray hair and icy white eyes that seem to pierce and dissect any unfortunate thing they happen to gaze upon.

As the party departs from the atrium, they are given 2 choices of where to go. On [[#Room 5 Descend Beneath the Temple|one side]] of the Atrium is a set of stairs that lead down to an underground section of the temple. On [[#Room 6 Another Long Hall|the other]] is a long hall with what appears to be a large door at the far end.

### Special Abilities
#### Perfect Memory (Ex)
Though they are not particularly intelligent, cassisians have perfect memories and remember everything they see or hear. They can faultlessly recite conversations they heard hundreds of years before. They also have the power to erase portions of their own memories, which they do (usually under orders from superior angels) to protect sensitive information.
#### Lesser Protective Aura (Su)
A cassisian has a lesser form of the protective aura possessed by more powerful angels. This protective aura grants the cassisian a +2 [deflection bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Bonus-Deflection-) to its AC against evil foes, and a +2 [resistance bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Resistance-Bonus) on all [saving throws](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) made against evil effects or spells cast by evil creatures. This aura extends to a radius of 5 feet, but can only benefit one additional creature other than the cassisian at any one time. A cassisian’s protective aura is fragile, and as soon as an evil creature successfully strikes the cassisian, or as soon as the cassisian fails a [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) against an evil source, its protective aura fades away and is no longer applicable. The cassisian can reactivate its protective aura by spending 1 minute concentrating upon the task.

### Ecology
**Environment** any good-aligned plane  
**Organization** solitary, pair, or squad (3–6)  
**Treasure** none
### Description
Cassisians are the weakest sort of angel, but are absolutely dedicated to the cause of good. They serve as messengers for more powerful angels, and on the Material Plane they are often bound to good mortals to serve as familiars, acting as spiritual guides, reciting platitudes and quoting scripture from various benign faiths and philosophies (some forgotten for centuries).

# Room 5: Descend Beneath the Temple
As the party descends to the lower level, the staircase vanishes beneath them, folding into completely smooth slats and creating a perfect ramp for the adventurers to fall down.
## Statblock: Tipping Stairs Trap (CR 5, XP 1,600)
**Type** mechanical; **Perception** DC 27; **Disable Device** DC 25; **Trigger** location; **Bypass** hidden lever (Perception DC 25 to Detect); **Reset** manual
**Effect** 50-ft. fall (5d6, falling damage), Reflex DC 20 avoids

# Room 6: The Tomb of the Dawnmother’s Faithful
A winding and beautiful ancient catacomb twists for miles under the temple and several surrounding city blocks, with new construction occasionally breaking through unsanctimoniously into long-sealed or abandoned portions of the temple underway. A complex system of mirrors placed carefully within thin chutes in the wall allows The Everlight to keep eternal watch over her entombed faithful, and beautiful stained glass murals depicting beautiful natural vistas create grottoes of effervescence. There is _much_ that could be explored here, but a DC 16 Knowledge (Religion) check will quickly remind the players that it is rumored that the divinely appointed spirits of Sarenrae’s guardian saints, as well as angelic guardians wander these halls, protecting their charges from would-be graverobbers. Push for the party to not stay here long and instead press towards their real goal. If the party insists on exploring the catacombs for anything of value, roll a d100. On anything less than a 95, the party’s first encounter is with the spirit of the Sarenite Saint, Saint Luxor Il Vathos, who commands them to depart. If any members of the party identify themselves as Sarenites, Saint Luxor stands firm in his duty, insisting that the party must depart from this place, and charging them with purging the evil that has . 
# Room 7: Hall of Connection
The so-called “Hall of Connection” — thus named in part because it connects the large atrium to the Grand Cathedral Hall and in part because of a long-established tradition of Sarenite couples who are married in the church to walk down the hall together in meditation on the nature of the shared connection they are forging — is a lengthy marble hall with stained glass walls that depict scenes from _”The Windsong Testaments”_. The hall is lined with many different statues, paintings, suits of armor, and various holy relics and artifacts left in the care of the church by wealthy nobles. A DC 35 Appraisal check reveals that the assembled wealth in the hall is worth approximately 960,000 GP if sold at wholesale market prices, and further investigation (DC 25 Perception and/or Detect Magic or similar) reveals some particularly significant (and/or potentially useful) items, including a Decanter of Endless Holy Water (12,500 GP), a Scroll of [Sacred Nimbus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sacred-nimbus) (CL 15, 937 GP), a Scroll of [Banishment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/banishment) (CL 20, DC 35 will save negates 1,500 GP) and a Scroll of [Holy Word](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/holy-word) (CL 25, DC 40, 2187.5 GP), as well as a book of Sarenite scriptures, _”The Windsong Testaments”_, whose white, velvet-wrapped cover is bound in gold thread and inlaid with gemstones (9,500 GP, contains several high-level Divine rituals, can DM with more info if it comes up). At the end of the hall is the Grand Hall, where the voices of the Dawnmother’s faithful have long been raised in prayer and supplication to Sarenrae.

Now, as the party approaches, it is *silent*. An aura of malice and dread can be felt emanating from what was once a place of radiant light and joy.

# Room 8: The Grand Hall of the Temple of the Dawnmother
As the party enters the room, Devros finds confirmation of horror beyond his worst imaginings. A line of supplicants lay bound before a group of priests and priestesses in the robes of Sarenrae. The broken-eyed, fanatical members of the clergy chant in a horrible, twisted tongue while strangling the Sarenite worshippers before them. Their words seem to call to some deep, slumbering piece of Devros’ soul. Abyssal. The tongue of Daemons… And at the head of their congregation, a woman he is utterly certain he’s known all his life, and yet equally as certainly knows he’s never seen before, whispers heresies into Father Traric’s ears. For his part, Father Traric’s eyes are glassy and half-focused, and his chanting seems more hesitant than the other priests’. Despite the heavy flanged whip in his hand, and the towering height between himself and the strange woman, he very obviously isn’t in any semblance of control over the situation. At last, the true horror of the scene finally unveils itself as Devros sees before him the object of Father Traric’s abuse… Sister Magdelon, bloody, bruised, beaten within an inch of her life, and crucified against the golden ankh, the divine symbol of Sarenrae. She may once have had the strength left to scream. Now, as Traric raised the whip, the strange woman’s cloying whispers seemingly encouraging, no, forcing him to continue in this barbarous act, the woman who raised Devros cannot muster so much as a whimper. Her eyes roll into the back of her head as the whip makes contact and she slumps forward against the pain of her restraints, rendered unconscious by the beating at last, flecks of foam spittle still clinging to her lips.

### Tactics
#### Before Combat
Traric will always delay his first turn until after [[#Statblock: Dolly Winslow|Dolly Winslow’s]] first turn, at which point, he will command the lesser clergy to seize the “heretical interlopers”. He will not, however, join the fight until directly commanded to by Dolly, or unless the party beelines for him.
#### During the Fight
After joining the fight, Traric will spend a round buffing with Bull’s Strength before truly engaging the adventurers. If Traric is deafened or Dolly is silenced, he begins to shake off her control, making DC 32 Will saves with a consecutive +1 bonus each round to overcome her spellcraft. If successful, he will turn on the creature of darkness that had been manipulating him.

### Special Abilities
**Devour Soul (Su)** As a standard action, an astradaemon that begins its turn with a grappled opponent can attempt to draw out and consume the soul of its victim, killing it instantly. This ability only works on living creatures, which may resist with a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw. The save is Constitution-based. For every 5 HD of the slain creature, the daemon gains a +1 profane bonus on attacks, saving throws, and checks for 24 hours. This ability does not consume all of the soul, and pieces of it still exist after the daemon completes its feast (enough to be able to resurrect the slain victim normally).  
  
**Soul Siphon (Su)** If a Small or larger living creature dies within 10 feet of an astradaemon, the daemon gains 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 bonus to Strength for 10 minutes. These bonuses stack with themselves. Incorporeal undead and living spirits traveling outside the body (such as a person using _astral projection_ or _magic jar_) take 1d8 points of damage each round within the daemon’s aura.

**Servant of the Bound Prince (Mythic) (Ex)** The ancient Astradaemon known as Morvath, who uses the convenience of the name and form of “Dolly Winslow” to enact it’s schemes upon the material plane, has long broken free from the yoke of the Four Horsemen and aims to bring about the return of the original ruler of the Abyss, the being known as the Bound Prince. As a result, Morvath draws significant divine power from it’s sleeping daemonic god. Morvath has gained the Cleric template, and may cast a select number of Witch spells as though they were Cleric spells. 

**Mythic Immortality**
If the creature is killed, it returns to life 24 hours later, regardless of the condition of its body or the means by which it was killed. When it returns to life, it isn’t treated as if it had rested, and doesn’t regain the use of abilities that are restored with rest until it next rests. This ability doesn’t apply if the creature is killed by a coup de grace or critical hit performed by either a mythic creature (or creature of even greater power) or a non-mythic creature wielding a weapon capable of bypassing epic damage reduction. If the creature is 10th mythic rank, it can be killed only by a coup de grace or critical hit made with an artifact.
### Tactics
#### Before Combat
“Dolly” is the true mastermind behind the corruption of the temple of Sarenrae. Her aim, however, was always to manipulate her “son” and magnum opus of tragedy and horror into seeing the scene before him. As the Adventurers fight her enthralled priests, she takes great glee in the senseless slaughter of corrupted innocents, but does not participate unless attacked.
#### During Combat
Dolly’s whole goal in enacting this scheme was to bring Devros before her and force him to slaughter everyone he loves in the hope of breaking his mind and awakening the sleeping fragment of her God within his soul. She doesn’t have any real interest in any of the other adventurers, and will use her spells and abilities to redirect any aggro sent her way. Once the priests have been slain, she will begin using _enervation_ to slaughter the captive parishioners. Once the parishioners have been slaughtered, she will use _enthrall_ to monologue at Devros about the futility of his struggle against her, ending with her beckoning him to her side. If her tempting is unsuccessful, or if the adventurers manage to drop her below 100 hp, she will _planeshift_ back to the Abyss.

If the party uses the Scroll of Banishment found in [[#Room 7 Another Long Hall]] at any point, she willingly fail the check and return to the Abyss. In that case, ll spells and effects she was maintaining will immediately end.
