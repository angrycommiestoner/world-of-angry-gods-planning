The Aspis Consortium has long dealt with attacks on their caravans by hiring mercenaries and guards for their goods, and accounting for some amount of successful highway robbery besides. Recently, however, a pack of particularly pesky goblins, the self-proclaimed “Tooth-n-Nail Tribe”, managed to get away with a significant sum of wealth in gemstones, books, and other trade goods of an uncommon enough variety that the Aspis Consortium has summoned a party of adventurers to seek their den in the southern foothills of the Aspodell Mountain and either slay or capture their leader, an oddly mutated goblin-ogre known as “Tark-Tark the Sniffer”

Quest w/ some exploration elements + dungeon run for adventurers level 2-6

Designing 3 encounters for the party to potentially encounter prior to discovering the goblin camp. Takes 3 days of IC travel to the cavern, assuming no faster mode of transportation available. Roll d% at the beginning of each day (75% chance for no encounter), allow for some in-character travel chatter, then move on to next day.

## Encounter 1: The Faerie Springs

In the foothills of the Aspodell mountains are rumors of a fog-shrouded spring which functions as a portal to the First World under the right conditions. Though the conditions today are not right, the spring is still full of the revitalizing natural energies of the first world. Water drawn from the spring is treated as Holy Water, and taking a bath in the spring grants a Sacred bonus to AC and Saving Throws equal to 1/2 of the subject’s level for the next 1d4 days. Construct and undead creatures do not gain any benefit from the springs. A DC 24 Knowledge (Planes) check reveals this information.

## Encounter 2: A Lost Child?

Upon the night that this encounter is rolled, as the party settles in to rest, they hear the far-away sound of a child weeping.

If the party chooses to investigate, they find an emaciated, dripping wet goblin child adjacent to a nearby river. The child will accept any aid that they offer, and will introduce herself as “Sasche” (pronounced like “Sash”) but is reluctant to speak of her origin, home, or family. If the party mentions that they are sent there to kill the leader of the Tooth-n-Nail Tribe, she will seem obviously disturbed at that, and a DC 23 Diplomacy check will get her to reveal that she is an “outcast, wicked child” of the Tooth-n-Nail tribe, and was sent away by Tark-Tark the Sniffer when he recently came to power within the tribe for being “too pretty to be a goblin”. A DC 23 Knowledge (Planes) check will reveal the goblin girl for what she is, a Changeling, born likely to a Hag and a Goblin father. This revelation, if divulged to the girl, will cause her to break down into helpless sobs and flee from the adventurers, while a DC 14 survival check will reveal that she has returned to the river where the party first found her. If pursued, she will reveal that she tried to drown herself, but couldn’t, which is why she was soaking wet when they met. She will divulge that she heard the voice of her “momma” in the waters of the river, and that she’s *scared* because of what little she knows about hags.

## Encounter 3: The Eagle’s Nest

As this encounter is rolled, a member of the party, determined at random, is scooped up by a [Giant Eagle](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/giant-eagle/). If the PC is capable of speaking Auran or communicating with animals, they are able to explain the mistake to the eagle, with a DC 18 Handle Animal check allowing the player to convince them that they are not food and a DC 14 Diplomacy check to convince the creature that they are, in fact, a friend.

If the PCs have already encountered Sasche, and manage to convince her to accompany them, the Eagle will *always* target her with it’s initial swooping attack. If the party decides to pursue her, a DC 22 Survival check allows them to track the giant eagle to it’s cliffside nest, though to their likely surprise, Sasche will have already befriended the eagle, it’s mate, and even their young, who she is play-wrestling with, the two downy chicks being exceptionally careful not to use their beaks or claws against her. If the party is aggressive, Sasche will intercede on the party’s behalf, using her newly discovered spell-like ability to *speak with animals* to talk the territorial birds down from attacking the intruders. On a successful DC 23 diplomacy check, the eagles will teach the party a whistled tune that can be used to summon them once while they are within these mountains.

# The Caves of the Tooth-n-Nail Clan
4 room dungeon, 1 trap, 2 encounters, 1 treasure room
The Caves of the Tooth-n-Nail Clan are a simple dungeon encounter for PCs level 2-5. While the PCs are not on a strict time limit, per se, it was implied that their reward could include a bonus if they finish quickly and return with the head of Tark-Tark the Sniffer
# Encounter 1: Fireburst Statues 2x (CR 3, 800 XP)

As the party enters the cavern, two modified Fireburst Statues, each carved in the rough likeness of a red dragon, emit jets of flame at the party, before letting loose a loud, echoing roar that is quickly responded to by chittering goblin voices.

## Encounter 2: The Den

Animal waste and half-rotting food strews the floor of this room, where a pack of 2d4+1 (minimum 3) [Goblin Dogs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/canines/dog/goblin-dog/) snarl at the party from the confines of their rusted cages as a pair of [Goblin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/goblin/) handlers hurriedly try to open the beast’s cages without having any fingers taken off. If there are fewer than 5 total Goblin Dogs, and the Goblin handlers are still up after releasing all the Goblin Dogs, they will take the opportunity to summon a [Bat Swarm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/bat/bat-swarm/) via a *flute of [summon nature’s ally III](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally/)*, which crumbles in their hands after use. If the party manages to down the goblins before using the flute, they may claim it as treasure for themselves.

## Encounter 3: The Village of the Tooth-N-Nail Clan

Hovels and tents populate this cavern. A communal cookfire sits in the center, though odds are high that nothing which could be reasonably described as “food” has ever been made there, and a dozen goblins armed for war are gathered around it. In addition, seated in a shabby throne made of carefully arranged stone, is the Chief of the Tooth-N-Nail Clan, Tark-Tark the Sniffer, a half-goblin half-ogre hybrid that combines the worst traits of both creatures. His most prominent feature is his nose, which is somehow both large and thin, narrowing down to an almost triangular point while also flaring at the base to accommodate almost cartoonishly large nostrils. He has the beady eyes and pointed teeth of a goblin, but the creature’s gangly, uneven limbs, disproportionately powerful to his size, suggest that Tark-Tark clearly came to rule the Tooth-N-Nail Goblins through brute force, and he will gladly attack his own goblin warriors if he believes they are not fighting hard enough.

## Encounter 4: The Treasure Room
Upon searching the body of Tark-Tark, the party will find a key and a map to a secret tunnel beneath Tark-Tark’s stone throne. Upon entering, they will find much of the stolen treasure they were sent to find, however, upon doing a final count and comparing to the list of stolen goods they were given by the Aspis Consortium, one book is missing. Since the party was not given a list of specific books, they have no way to determine which one, but upon reporting this news to their Aspis Consortium benefactor, the merchant will show obvious consternation, with a DC 22 Sense Motive check revealing that the consortium member was *expecting* that outcome. The party will be thanked and rewarded with 5% of the gold value of the recovered goods (1,000 GP to be split among the party), plus ten fame with the Aspis Consortium (i.e. local Cheliax fame).

## Narrative & Future Connections
The book that is missing is a book of ritual magic being secretly transported by this caravan to a Conference Z Agent in Egorian. The daughter of A. X. Adrius, Marcille LaFey Adrius, is the party’s benefactor, and the reason why this operation is being kept so quiet is because one of the rituals contained therein is a powerful binding ritual
