# Overview
Plot Outline for Niya's next Ascension quest/first part of Wild Hunt plotline

# Goals & Objectives
- Create and flesh out 3-4 named NPC companions, each of whom should be approximately equivalent to the CR 15 Wild Hunt Scout statblock found below. 
	- Introduce these companions to Niya through roleplay 
		- Have Theras & Chamion challenge Niya to a fight?
		- Allow Atropos and Twig-And-Branch to both quickly and distinctly show where their loyalties lie (Magdh for Atropos, and himself, then Magdh for Twig-And-Branch)
- Present Niya with new information. While Magdh will find other ways to repay the upstart Horned Prince for his reckless abuse of the First World’s formalities, she has forseen the hunt’s target, and wants Niya to, instead, participate earnestly in the Wild Hunt.
	- The target of the Wild Hunt is Galandula Bitterthorn, a powerful and storied Night Hag who, in the wake of the disappearance of Alazhra, along with Gyronna and Mestama, has attempted to claim the domain of The Dream Eater for herself.
		- Galandula has been building her power using her affinity for dream magic to psychically siphon magical and divine energies from the mortal souls her followers (most of whom are lesser night hags and changelings charmed, tortured, or merely intimidated into doing her bidding) are haunting.
