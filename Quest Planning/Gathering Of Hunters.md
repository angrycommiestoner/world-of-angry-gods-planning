# Overview
Plot Outline for Niya's next Ascension quest/first part of Wild Hunt plotline

# Goals & Objectives
- Create and flesh out 3-4 named NPC companions, each of whom should be approximately equivalent to the CR 15 Wild Hunt Scout statblock found below. 
	- Introduce these companions to Niya through roleplay 
		- Have Theras & Chamion challenge Niya to a fight?
		- Allow Atropos and Twig-And-Branch to both quickly and distinctly show where their loyalties lie (Magdh for Atropos, and himself, then Magdh for Twig-And-Branch)
- Present Niya with new information. While Magdh will find other ways to repay the upstart Horned Prince for his reckless abuse of the First World’s formalities, she has forseen the hunt’s target, and wants Niya to, instead, participate earnestly in the Wild Hunt.
	- The target of the Wild Hunt is Galandula Bitterthorn, a powerful and storied Night Hag who, in the wake of the disappearance of Alazhra, along with Gyronna and Mestama, has attempted to claim the domain of The Dream Eater for herself.
		- Galandula has been building her power using her affinity for dream magic to psychically siphon magical and divine energies from the mortal souls her followers (most of whom are lesser night hags and changelings charmed, tortured, or merely intimidated into doing her bidding) are haunting.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES
#### Crystal (Su)
A wild hunt scout can manifest a green crystal in her free hand as a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions); this crystal vanishes as soon as it leaves her possession. As a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions), a wild hunt scout can fire a beam of green energy from her crystal. This is a ranged [touch attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks) with a range increment of 40 feet that deals 3d6 points of force damage on a hit. A creature struck by this beam must succeed at a DC 27 [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save or be permanently [blinded](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded). The save DC is [Charisma-based](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-).
#### Force Scimitar (Su)
As a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions), a wild hunt scout can [summon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Summon-Sp-) a crystalline [scimitar](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/scimitar). Attacks with this [scimitar](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/scimitar) resolve as if they were [touch attacks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks) and deal force damage. Outside of its creator’s hands, a force [scimitar](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/scimitar) vanishes.
#### Wild Hunt Link (Su)
All creatures in a wild hunt scout’s wild hunt link share each other’s senses. As long as a creature benefits from this link, it gains a +4 [insight bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus) on [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) and [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks. If at least one creature in the link disbelieves an [illusion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion), all creatures in the link are considered to disbelieve the illusion. Wild hunt [fey](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey) in this link are never considered [flat-footed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed) against a foe unless all of them are considered [flat-footed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed) against that foe.
### ECOLOGY
**Environment** any land  
**Organization** solitary, invasion (2–6), or wild hunt  
**Treasure** standard
Wild hunt scouts relish the chance to seek revenge upon those who have wronged or insulted the wild hunt. They grow bored quickly when the stakes are not lethal, yet they rarely let their bloodlust cloud their tactical choices.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES
#### Fated (Su)
A norn adds her [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier as an [insight bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus) to AC and on [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) checks.
#### Shears (Su)
A norn’s shears function as a +5 [mithral](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Mithral) [keen](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Keen) speed [scimitar](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/scimitar), but only for a norn.
#### Shift Fate (Su)
As an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions), a norn can force any one target within 120 feet to reroll a saving throw—this ability must be used immediately after the saving throw is rolled, and the target must abide by the result of this second roll.
#### Snip Thread (Su)
As a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) up to three times per day but no more often than once every 1d4 rounds, a norn may produce a golden thread linked to a creature’s fate and then attempt to snip it short with her shears. The target creature must be within 120 feet and in the norn’s line of sight. The target immediately takes 20d6 points of damage ([Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) DC 30 for half). If the target dies from this damage, the norn has cut through the thread—in this case, the target may only be restored to life via [miracle](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle), [wish](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish), or divine intervention. This is a death effect. The Save DC is [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)-based.
### ECOLOGY
**Environment** cold mountains  
**Organization** solitary, pair, or trio  
**Treasure** double (+3 hide [armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus), shears, golden thread worth 500 gp, other treasure)
Ancient beyond imagining, the norns are a race of powerful women who hold in their hands the physical manifestation of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread. They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings. Worshiped as gods by some, the norns do little to discourage this veneration.
A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.
