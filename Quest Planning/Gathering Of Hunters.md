# Overview
Plot Outline for Niya's next Ascension quest/first part of Wild Hunt plotline

# Goals & Objectives
- Create and flesh out 3-4 named NPC companions, each of whom should be approximately equivalent to the CR 15 Wild Hunt Scout statblock found below. 
	- Introduce these companions to Niya through roleplay 
		- Have Theras & Chamion challenge Niya to a fight?
		- Allow Atropos and Twig-And-Branch to both quickly and distinctly show where their loyalties lie (Magdh for Atropos, and himself, then Magdh for Twig-And-Branch)
- Present Niya with new information. While Magdh will find other ways to repay the upstart Horned Prince for his reckless abuse of the First World’s formalities, she has forseen the hunt’s target, and wants Niya to, instead, participate earnestly in the Wild Hunt.
	- The target of the Wild Hunt is Galandula Bitterthorn, a powerful and storied Night Hag who, in the wake of the disappearance of Alazhra, along with Gyronna and Mestama, has attempted to claim the domain of The Dream Eater for herself.
		- Galandula has been building her power using her affinity for dream magic to psychically siphon magical and divine energies from the mortal souls her followers (most of whom are lesser night hags and changelings charmed, tortured, or merely intimidated into doing her bidding) are haunting.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES
#### Crystal (Su)
A wild hunt scout can manifest a green crystal in her free hand as a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions); this crystal vanishes as soon as it leaves her possession. As a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions), a wild hunt scout can fire a beam of green energy from her crystal. This is a ranged [touch attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks) with a range increment of 40 feet that deals 3d6 points of force damage on a hit. A creature struck by this beam must succeed at a DC 27 [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save or be permanently [blinded](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded). The save DC is [Charisma-based](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-).
#### Force Scimitar (Su)
As a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions), a wild hunt scout can [summon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Summon-Sp-) a crystalline [scimitar](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/scimitar). Attacks with this [scimitar](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/scimitar) resolve as if they were [touch attacks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks) and deal force damage. Outside of its creator’s hands, a force [scimitar](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/scimitar) vanishes.
#### Wild Hunt Link (Su)
All creatures in a wild hunt scout’s wild hunt link share each other’s senses. As long as a creature benefits from this link, it gains a +4 [insight bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus) on [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) and [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks. If at least one creature in the link disbelieves an [illusion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion), all creatures in the link are considered to disbelieve the illusion. Wild hunt [fey](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey) in this link are never considered [flat-footed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed) against a foe unless all of them are considered [flat-footed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed) against that foe.
### ECOLOGY
**Environment** any land  
**Organization** solitary, invasion (2–6), or wild hunt  
**Treasure** standard
Wild hunt scouts relish the chance to seek revenge upon those who have wronged or insulted the wild hunt. They grow bored quickly when the stakes are not lethal, yet they rarely let their bloodlust cloud their tactical choices.
### META-NARRATIVE INFORMATION
This statblock is meant to be a point of comparison and reference for named NPC statblocks, who will be filling the role of the typical Wild Hunt Scouts in a Wild Hunt. Refer to the [[#Wild Hunt Archer]] statblock for basic Wild Hunt unit.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES
#### Fated (Su)
A norn adds her [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier as an [insight bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus) to AC and on [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) checks.
#### Shears (Su)
A norn’s shears function as a +5 [mithral](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Mithral) [keen](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Keen) speed [scimitar](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/scimitar), but only for a norn.
#### Shift Fate (Su)
As an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions), a norn can force any one target within 120 feet to reroll a saving throw—this ability must be used immediately after the saving throw is rolled, and the target must abide by the result of this second roll.
#### Snip Thread (Su)
As a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) up to three times per day but no more often than once every 1d4 rounds, a norn may produce a golden thread linked to a creature’s fate and then attempt to snip it short with her shears. The target creature must be within 120 feet and in the norn’s line of sight. The target immediately takes 20d6 points of damage ([Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) DC 30 for half). If the target dies from this damage, the norn has cut through the thread—in this case, the target may only be restored to life via [miracle](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle), [wish](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish), or divine intervention. This is a death effect. The Save DC is [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)-based.
### ECOLOGY
**Environment** cold mountains  
**Organization** solitary, pair, or trio  
**Treasure** double (+3 hide [armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus), shears, golden thread worth 500 gp, other treasure)
Ancient beyond imagining, the norns are a race of powerful women who hold in their hands the physical manifestation of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread. They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings. Worshiped as gods by some, the norns do little to discourage this veneration.
A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.
### META-NARRATIVE INFORMATION 
Atropos uses an unaltered Norn statblock and will probably be by far the strongest of Niya’s cohorts unless and until Theras and Chamion become Horae Queens of their respective seasons. Chosen directly by Magdh for this role, rather than volunteers, as Theras and Chamion, or volunteered by a liege in lieu of performing the role themselves, as Twig-And-Branch was, Atropos is a trusted advisor to She-Of-Three-Faces. As such, she is also the one who comes bearing news of the changes to Niya’s plans.

## Twig-And-Branch
An odd First World Treant, Twig-And-Branch is far more sly than he prefers to let on. A strategic and planning mastermind, he claims a predominantly advisory role to Magdh’s chosen Monarch. He also regularly complains that he never wanted to be involved in this endeavor in the first place.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES
#### Animate Trees (Sp)
A treant can animate any trees within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a tree to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant (although it has only one slam attack and lacks the treant’s animation and rock-throwing abilities), gaining the treant’s vulnerability to fire. If the treant that animated it terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the tree immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state.
#### Double Damage Against Objects (Ex)
A treant or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage.
#### Treespeech (Ex)
A treant has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a continual _[speak with plants](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-plants)_ spell, and most plants greet them with an attitude of friendly or helpful.
### ECOLOGY
**Environment** any forest  
**Organization** solitary or grove (2–7)  
**Treasure** standard
Treants are guardians of the forest and speakers for the trees. As long-lived as the forests themselves, and seeing themselves as parents and shepherds rather than gardeners, treants are slow and methodical in most things but terrifying when forced to fight in defense of their flock. Though they rarely seek out the companionship of the short-lived races, and have an inherent distrust of change, they have been known to tolerate those who seek to learn from their long, rambling monologues, especially if the pupils express a desire to help protect the wildlands. Yet against those who would threaten the forest, especially loggers who seek to harvest wood for lumber or those who try to clearcut a section of forest in order to build a fort or establish a town, the treants’ wrath is swift and devastating. They are particularly gifted at tearing down what others build—a trait that serves angry treants well.
Treants are primarily solitary creatures, with a given individual sometimes responsible for an entire forest, but they occasionally come together in small groups called groves to share news and reproduce. In times of grave danger, all of the groves in a region may gather for a great months-long meeting called a moot, but such events are exceedingly rare, and millennia may go by between them.
The typical treant is 30 feet tall, with a trunk 2 feet in diameter, and weighs 4,500 pounds. Treants tend to resemble the species of trees most common in their woodland territories.

#### ABOUT
While most nymphs bond with a natural feature, such as a tree, pool, or cave, horai are rare nymphs associated with a specific time—the summer or winter solstice—rather than a location. Horai erect simple astronomical calendars near their home, which they use to mark the moment when the sun reaches its highest or lowest point in the sky. An hora tied to the summer solstice grows more powerful as the sun reaches its height, while an hora tied to the winter solstice is sickly and weak. The opposite holds true for winter horai, who are weak in summer and strong in winter. Meanwhile, autumn and spring horai draw power near the autumnal and vernal equinoxes, becoming weaker around the opposite equinox.
