## **Queen’s Blast**
*Associated Sphere:* Destruction; *Prerequisites:* Energy Bomb (blast shape); *Talent Range:* see text 
**Talent Description:** A talent that allows the caster to significantly delay the detonation of their imbued destructive blast.
**Talent Effect:** With a touch, you spend a spell point may imbue a creature, or object (Solid) with a Destructive Blast. You may add an additional blast shape to the imbued blast by spending an additional spell point; you must pay all other associated costs when doing this. The Created Explosive lasts for a number of hours equal to your caster level. You may spend an additional spell point when placing the explosive to instead have the effect last for one day per caster level. You are aware of the presence of your Explosive as if detecting its square using detect magic as long as it remains in your line of sight and is not otherwise obscured. As a standard action, you may Detonate the Explosive. You may only detonate a single explosive at a time, and must be within Long range of the explosive to detonate it. 

This deals damage equal to the imbued destructive blast damage to the object it was placed on, as well as to any adjacent creatures or objects. If there are any additional blast shapes applied to the imbued blast, they also apply here. If those shapes require touch attacks, ranged touch attacks, selected squares, or other such choices, you must have line of sight to the explosive in order to be able to choose the targets. If you do not have line of sight, those targets are chosen randomly from those eligible for the blast. Use the caster of the blast’s bonuses for all relevant rolls.
## **Blade Beast (form)**
*Associated Sphere:* Conjuration; *Prerequisites:* —; *Talent Range:* personal 
**Talent Description:** Grant a conjuration companion the ability to shift into weapons their master is proficient with
**Talent Effect:** The conjuration companion gains the ability to take the form of any single weapon its master is proficient with as a move action. While wielded as a weapon, the conjuration companion is treated as though it possesses a +1 enhancement bonus. At 4th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1. This stacks with other enhancement bonuses, but cannot be used to gain an enhancement bonus greater than +5 or a total weapon bonus greater than +10. Bonuses above +5 must be spent on weapon properties.

While in Blade Beast form, a conjuration companion can take no actions except for purely mental actions.

At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: dancing, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or vorpal. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's base price modifier (see the Magic Weapon Special Ability Descriptions). These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the conjuration companion takes the Blade Beast form, and cannot be changed until the next time they use this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the person who summoned the companion wields the Blade Beast.

This talent may be taken additional times. Each additional time it is taken, you may either gain access to a single arsenal trick that benefits weapons or add four Weapon Special Abilities from the Armorist Bound Equipment ability to the list of abilities that you can add to your Blade Beast. This trick only benefits the blade beast weapon. You count as an armorist equal to your character level -4 for the purposes of selecting an arsenal trick.

**Talent Effect:** As a standard action, you may spend a number of spell points up to a limit of your casting modifier in order to create a magical link between you and a Conjuration Companion with the Blade Beast (Form) Talent. In doing so, you are able to gain access to a number of benefits from form talents which your Companion possesses equal to the number of spell points spent.
