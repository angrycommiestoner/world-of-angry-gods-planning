*The frenzied berserker is constantly seeking out more conflict to feed her craving for battle.*
## Frenzy (Ex)
A frenzied berserker calls upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, she can frenzy for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can frenzy for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution do not increase the total number of rounds that a frenzied berserker can frenzy per day. A frenzied berserker can enter frenzy as a free action. The total number of rounds of frenzy per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While you are in a frenzy you do not benefit from the Rage ability nor do you benefit from similar effects such as the Rage spell. 

While in a frenzy, a frenzied berserker gains a +6 morale bonus to her Strength. If she makes a full attack, she can make an additional attack at her highest bonus. (Not cumulative with effects such as haste or speed weapons). In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class and suffers 2 nonlethal damage per round. While frenzied, a frenzied berserker cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.

A frenzied berserker can try to end her frenzy at the start of her turn by making a Will save (DC 15 + 1/2 her barbarian level), and is fatigued after the frenzy ends for 1 minute. A frenzied berserker can only make this Will save once per start of her turn. However, she can receive outside help (see below). A frenzied berserker cannot willingly enter a new frenzy while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter frenzy multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a frenzied berserker falls unconscious, her frenzy immediately ends.

At her GM's discretion, a frenzied berserker can also be forced into a frenzy due to a traumatic experience, which she can prevent with a Will save (DC 20 + 1/2 her barbarian level). A frenzied berserker in a frenzy will prioritize the cause of the damage or traumatic experience, and seek it in the direction from where it originated. Allies can use the aid another action to assist this saving throw with skills like Diplomacy (multiple uses of aid another stack together), as they attempt to calm him down. On a successful save, her frenzy ends.

During a frenzy, the frenzied berserker must attack those she perceives as foes to the best of her ability. Should she run out of foes while in a frenzy, her rampage continues. She must then attack the nearest creature and fight that opponent without regard to friendship, innocence or health (The target's or her own). However, if there are no longer any hostile targets (targets who sheathe their weapons and stop attacking no longer count as hostile) she can roll the saving throw to end her frenzy twice and take the better result. While in a frenzy a frenzied berserker can use rage powers and otherwise counts as being in a rage if doing so is advantageous to her. 

This ability replaces rage.
## Inspire Frenzy (Ex)
At 3rd level, a frenzied berserker can inspire frenzy an ally while she herself is frenzied. As a standard action, a single willing ally within 30 ft. of her can gain the benefits and disadvantages of her frenzy. The frenzied berserker uses an additional round of frenzy while inspiring a frenzy in another. In addition, the frenzied ally must make their own Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 their character level) at the start of their turn to come out of the frenzy, or continue draining rounds of frenzy from the frenzied berserker. Similar to the frenzied berserker, her allies can also roll the saving throw to end the frenzy twice and take the better result if there are no longer any hostile targets to attack. At 6th level, and every three levels after, the frenzied berserker can inspire frenzy in an additional ally. 

This ability replaces trap sense.  

## Greater Frenzy (Ex)
At 11th level, the frenzied berserker gains a +8 morale bonus to Strength, can make an additional attack at her highest bonus plus an additional attack with a -5 penalty during a full attack, and she suffers 3 non-lethal damage per round while in a frenzy.   

This ability replaces greater rage.

## Deathless Frenzy (Ex)
At 14th level, a frenzied berserker does not suffer negative effects for falling below 0 hit points while in a frenzy (including death). She still accumulates damage, and when her frenzy ends, suffers all appropriate effects (including death due to her wounds). A frenzied berserker reduced to negative hit points equal to twice her Constitution score can no longer gain the benefits of healing.   

This ability replaces indomitable will.

## Tireless Frenzy (Ex)
At 17th level, a frenzied berserker is no longer fatigued after a frenzy ends, although she continues to take nonlethal damage per round while frenzied. 

This ability replaces tireless rage.

## Mighty Frenzy (Ex) 
At 20th level, the frenzied berserker gains a +10 morale bonus to Strength, can make two additional attacks at her highest bonus during a full attack, and suffers 4 nonlethal damage per round while in a frenzy.  

This ability replaces mighty rage.
