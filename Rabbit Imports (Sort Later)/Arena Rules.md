# Welcome to the Arena! 
Players may choose to participate in Player Vs Player battles here in the arena for gold and glory!   
## Seasons
Each year will contain four seasons of Arena, each lasting three months: 
- Spring Season: 3/1 - 5/31
- Summer Season: 6/1 - 8/31
- Fall Season: 9/1 - 11/30
- Winter Season: 12/1 - 2/28 / 29
## Rules
Players may enter into battles against varying numbers of other players, but typically these battles will be structured as 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 battles. Each week, a player will gold according to their level as per the Gold Rewards for Victory chart below. They may participate in as many additional battles beyond that as they would like, but they will not earn additional gold or Fame. The arena does not contain level brackets, and players of all levels are free to challenge other players of any level! 

The relative level and number of opponents will determine the amount of fame a player will earn for a battle. Each week, a player may only earn fame equal to the amount granted by their most rewarding battle. For example, Tom and Sally are both level 3, they enter into a duel, and Sally wins, earning 1 fame. Later that week, Sally duels Robert who is level 5 and earns 2 Fame. This week, Sally would earn 2 fame from her duel with Robert, as it is her most valuable battle, but only earn gold from one duel. No matter what modifiers are applied to the fame values for a battle, a given player cannot earn less than 1 fame or more than 4 fame in a given battle.
## Rewards
### Arena Victory Points (AVP)
For each victory a player earns in the arena, they also earn AVP (Arena Victory Points) equal to the amount of fame they would have earned from that battle (minimum 1 AVP per battle), even if they would not have earned gold or Fame from that battle due to having already earned gold or Fame that week. Unlike with Fame, players may earn more than 4 AVP per battle. AVP totals will be tracked by the game masters, and the top three AVP holders at the end of each season will receive special rewards. AVP totals do not last from one season into the next.  

As an example, a battle occurs between two groups of players. Team one contains one level seven player. Team two contains three level three players. For each character on team one, there are three opponents, so they would gain 2 additional fame for this battle. Because the opponents are more than two levels below them, this is reduced by -1. So this battle is worth 2 fame for them in total. The average character level of team 2 is four levels below the average team level of team 1, so they would also gain 2 additional fame for this battle, making this battle worth 3 fame for each character in total.

## Death In The Arena
The arena is magically protected, those who fall on its sands are only ever rendered unconscious and will not die, regardless of the amount of damage or conditions dealt to them. So go nuts! 
## Player Expectations & Rules Adjudication
Players are expected to coordinate battles themselves, and they will not take place at set times or days. Players do not have to be in the same location in the world in order to participate in an arena battle together, and as such may participate from any location in the server. Arena battles are considered “Time Bubbled” and do not take downtime to participate in. Characters are assumed to be well rested and have had an opportunity to prepare accordingly for the match. Spells, items, and actions taken inside of the arena do not otherwise impact the world outside of the arena. 

If players need adjudication on a specific outcome or rule, they may ping the Dungeon Masters role and a dungeon master will rule on the situation for them. These rulings are considered final until the end of the match, although they can be discussed further after the combat has resolved.  

Players are expected to behave in a sportsmanlike manner, and particularly rude, cruel, or unsportsmanlike behavior will result in automatically forfeiting a match. Repeated serious or particularly egregious behavior may result in loss of AVP or strikes against a player.
